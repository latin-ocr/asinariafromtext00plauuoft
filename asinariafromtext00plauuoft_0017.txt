JNTRODUCTJON. xiii

Andronicus introduced this Comedy at Rome first 240 13.c.‚ was
followed by Naevius who like him wrote Tragedies also3 then
came Plautus, Caecilius, and Terentius who exclusively devoted
themselves to comoedia palliata. In fruitsulness of production,
independent use os his Greek originals, power of language,
lively delineation of character, readiness and wit, Plautus stands
first os all the Roman comedians¹.

Gellius (111. 3) states that 130 pieces passed under Plautus’
name. Servius says in the introduction to his Commentary on
the Aeneid—‘ Plautus is said by some to have written 21 plays,
by others 40, by others 100.' The large numbers in these
estimates no doubt include some early plays by unknown authors
under the name os Plautus. Varro, who first treated the subject
in anything of a critical spirit, enumerates 21 plays as ascribed
to Plautus in all the lists (indices), all of which we possess except
the Vidularia, which was lost between the 6th and 1 1th centuries
ΑΛ). These are the Fabulae Varronianae. In a second class
Varro places the plays which were set down to Plautus in most
of the lists. This class probably included 19, which' with the
21 undoubted comedies would give the 40 os Servius’ second
estimate. Outside the 21 undisputed plays we know the titles
only of 32. The extant plays are given in the ordinary MSS. in
the following order: Amphitruo, Asinaria, Aulularia, Captivi,
Curculio, Casina, Cistellaria, Epidicus, Bacchides, Mostellaria,
Menaechmi, Miles Gloriosus, Mercator, Pseudolus, Poenulus,
Persa, Rudens, Stichus, Trinummus, Truculentus. This order
is alphabetical but takes account only of the initial letter
in the titles; the one case where the initial letter is neglected
—the Bacchides-is to be explained by the fact that an
allusion in the Bacchides shews it to be a later play than the
Epidicus, hence it is placed aster the Epidicus in the list. Necd-
less to say these do not all possess the same merit, and are not
to be ranked in the same class. Brix calls 6 (Aulularia, Captivi,
Bacchides, Menaechmi, Pseudolus, Trinummus) first-rate-—but
there is much to be said against the exclusion of several others,
