Argumentum. The metrical
summaries os the contenis os the
Plautine plays are of two sons,
acrostich and non-acrostich. We
have the acrostich arguments of
all the plays except the Bacchides.
The non-acrostich arguments sur-
vive to five plays only (Amph.
Aul. Mil. Merc. Pseud.). They
are of ι 5 lines each except that to
the Amphitruo, which is os 10.

The acrostichs are the earlier
and the better in knowledge of
Plautine usage and versification.
They are considered to belong to
the best eriod os Plautine studies
in the 7t cent. A.u.c.‚ the date to
which the Prologues belong, and
may on the suggestion os F. Osann
be ascribed to Aurelius Opilius
(84 B.c.) who is mentioned by
Gellius 111. 3. 1 as the author of
‘ indices ' on Plautus.

The non-acrostichs are later and

Apollinaris of Carthage (150 A.D.)
who wrote the arguments to the
books of the Aeneid and to Te-

rence.
As ‘ Asinaria’ is a word os some

length the acrostich gives a reason—
able notion os the contents of the
play. Is the name os the play is·
a very short word not much can
be expected from the acrostich.

1. amanti mio, danasterauxili-
aricr: argento, abl. instrum. ‘with
a sum ofinoney.’ The form auxill-
arler has never been satisfactorily
explained. The ordinary infin.
pass. and depon- in i is originally
dat. (=indogerm. *agl e.g. agi,
dici, sequi ὅγε. The longer form
agi-er, dici-er, laudari-er, is found
contemporaneously, but not earlier.
Stolz (Miiller Hdb. 11.² 380) would
explain these as formed from the
usual infinitive in i with the in-
finitive-suffix -ere borrowed from
the thematic verb. The shorten-
ing ·cr from -ere he illustrates by
biber (Titinius) and haber (Corp.
Inscr. Lat. 8. 8369).

4. numerari, ‘to be countedss
osten os a cash-payment. See note
on Epid. 305 and v. 50¹ infr. The
order os the words is iussit pretium
relatum Saureae ob asinos numerari
seruolo Leonidae.
