unsulfilled condition. See on v.
188 and add as further examples
Most. 544 dicam si confi’ssns sit,
Pers. 216 fatear si ila sim.

394. ad tonsorem ire dixit,
¹ he said he was going to the bar·
ber's’: ire sor se [lurum esse, as in
v. 366.

396. conuerti, sed is Ussing's
almost certain correction of the
MSS. cum uenisset. It is possible
to get a meaning out of the mss.
reading by understanding eo sc. acl
tonsorem. But this is strained‚ and
Ussing’s correction is so simple
and convincing that further discus·
sion is unnecessary. The MSS.
give rediit, which if kept must be
scanned as an iambus. It seems
sinipler to read with Leo redz'l.

that money now?’ For z'd=‘that

399. uoster, ‘of yours,’ like

noster ‘os ours,' supra 58 and 387.

aside—‘I shall be able to learn
directly whether it is he.’ with the
description given in the two sol-
lowing lines compare the descrip-
tion>- Capt. 647, Pseud. 1218,
Merc. 630. Libanus os course
describes Leonidas who is to im-
personate Saurea.

400. rutulus, ‘red-headed‚' the
regular colour ascribed to slaves.
Thus in the standing comie-masks
red-hair denoted a slave, just as
much as white marked the old
man and black the young man.

auquantum nonnosus, ‘with
a considerable paunch.' Cf. Rud.
3¹7·

401. commoda statura. Com-
modus is used to describe whatever
is proper os its kind. Here the
ordinary height a man may be
expected to have. v. 725 commodae
minae, and so with capillus, talen-
!um, cyathus, ἃς. See Langen,
Beitrage p. ²53· The fierce look
and scowl have earned for their
owner the heroic name Leonidas.
