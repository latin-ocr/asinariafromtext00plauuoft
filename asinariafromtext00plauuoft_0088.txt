the abusive terms to which they
had to submit from their superiors.
For gymnasium flagri, ‘exercise-
ground of the lash‚' cf. Aul. 404
lotus doleo atque oppido perii: ita
me iste habuit senex gymnasium:
for custos carceris, ‘gaobguardiam’
cf. Capt. 651 qnid cessatis, con-
pedes, currere ad me meaque am-
plecti crura, ut uos custodiam ?

salueto--salue‚ cf. Cure. 235,
Men. 1076, Rud. 417; but ualeto
is not used sor nale.

298. 0 catenarum colone, i. e.
‘qui assidue calenas colis, ut agrum
col0nu5.' The Roman colonia is
pressed into Plautus⁷ service, Epid.
343, Pseud. 1100, ἃς.

0 uirgarum lasciuia, ‘thou pas-
time of rods‚’ because rods have
wantoned and curled playfully
about your back so often.

299. From the abuse showered
upon slaves Leonidas passes to
the punishment inflicted on them,
and extracts a jest from that too.
A slave who was to be flogged
was tied up, infr. v. 564, v. 617,
Trin. 247. To prevent his kicking
a weight was attached to his feet.
If the weight was heavy enough

to keep him quiet he might be
said to be in a state of equipoise.
Hence Leonidas who has hung
up Libanus says that he knows by
experience what his weight is, be·
cause he knows what weight was
required to keep him quiet, or to
continue his own metaphor, ‘to
balance’ him. ν
nudum, i.e. stripped for flog-
m .
g 150. expendi, ‘weighed you,’
i.e. sastened you up to the bearn.

301. pondo, adv. abl. ospondus‚
‘by weight.’ Cf. Rud. 9¹4· Roby
1209.

per pedes, ‘ita ut caput inferius
esset, cf. Cas. 367 ut quidem pedibus
pendeas.‘ Ussing. There are two
different punishments described.
In the first v. 299 the slave is tied
up by the hands with a weight at-
tached to his feet. In this second
he is hung up head downwards
without a weight.

302. quo argumento istuc? sc.
probas or some such word omitted
colloquially. Cf. Mil. 1001 and
1015, Rud. 1023, Truc. 169.

303. aequom eentumponmum‚
‘a fair hundredweight,’ neither
