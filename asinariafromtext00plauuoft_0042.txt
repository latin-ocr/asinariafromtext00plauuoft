took stand on Greek ground. The school and the stage were
thoroughly anti-Roman. They were two of the strongest in-
fluences at work throughout the whole period in sapping Roman
conservatisrn at the most brilliant era it ever had.

The Roman police-regulations undesignedly fostered this
Hellenism. The Roman police allowed no politics on the stage.
Comedy was allowed to bring sorward no Roman on the pulpi-
tum. Even when it was admitted as a national amusement it
‘ remained as it were relegated to foreign lands.'

This will explain why the plays of Plautus and his fellows
are all palliatae. It is a remarkable illustration of this effect of
police-regulations at Rome that almost contemporaneously a
national comedy was introduced in the provincial towns. The
earliest composer of togatae known to us is Titinius. His pieces
also were based upon the New Attic Comedy: but with him it
was imitation, not translation. The scene was laid in Italy:
the actors appeared in the Italian dress (toga). The pieces really
dealt with Italian life and habits. The life represented was
usually that of southern Latian towns, Setia, Velitrae, Ferenti-
num, and the delineations were fresh and lively. The very
titles of Titinius' plays illustrate the life of which he treated.

But at Rome the general Hellenic influence, the absence of
a Latin literature, the demand for theatrical entertainment, and
the stringency of the police restrictions prevented the production
of anything except palliatae, in which, as has been said, there
was nothing really Latin save the language in which the play
was dressed.

And so the conditions of life depicted were Hellenic, cosmo-
politan, certainly not Roman. Before the time of the New
Comedy Greek ideas about slavery had changed. Euripides
may be taken as the mouthpiece of liberal Athens on the
subject (see Ion 854, Hel. 728). ‘The slave-world was utterly
different ; the Roman slave was a piece of household—furniture‚
the Attic slave was a servant. Where marriages of slaves occur
or a master carries on a kindly conversation with his slave, the
Roman translators ask their audience not to take offence at
such things which are usual in Athens; and when at a later
