are intended to give a clue to their dispositions; frequently b)
way of ironical contrast high-sounding heroic names are at-
tached to low mean persons. Thus here the complacent father
is Demaenetus (Δημαίνετος) ‘praised hythe people' because of
his professed devotion to the public service (vid. 870 ego censeo
eum etiam homincm in senata dare operam aut cluenlibus), a
profession with which the reality as revealed in the play stands
in glaring contrast. The name of the procuress is written at
the head of Scene 3 (v. 153) as cler-eta, it is given in cod. Β,
v. 751, as Claeareta. Most editors spell Clcaerela (Κλεαιρέτη)
but it should rather be Cleareta ,Κλεορέτη) ‘nam Κλεάρετος et
Τιμαρέτη nota nomina sunt; quasi quae laudem acquirat'
(Ussing, 1. 349). Argyrtppus at first sight appears to be one
of those grand names formed from ἵππος, so suitable for a
young ‘blood,⁷ with which the aristocratic wife of Strepsiades
has made us familiar in the Nubes (vv. 63—4)

ἡ μὲν γὰρ ἵππον προσετίθει πρὸς τοῦνομα,
Ξάνθιππον ἢ Χαίριππον ἢ Καλλιππίδην.

Cf. Stratippocles in the Epidicus. But there is a deeper mean-
ing in the name. A rgyrzppus to get the money is obliged to
act as a horse and carry his slave on his back v. 699 ff, hence
he is ὁ τοῦ ἀργυρίου ἕνεκα ἵππος. The girl's name, Pht'lenz'um
in the MSS„ should be Philaenium (Φιλαινίον), a well-known
name, one of the diminutives so often applied to slaves of both
sexes, cf. Erotium and Glycerium. The rival lover is Diabolus,
the slanderous informer (ὁ διαβάλλων), who tells the shameful
story to the wife (v. 811). Dz'abulus, as if from Διάβουλος, is
metrically impossible, as the penultimate is short, v. 634. Arte-
mona=’Ap·1-ep„‹.3. Ussing derives it from ἀρτέμων, ‘a foresail‚’
rather than the Epic adj. ἀρτεμής, ‘sase and sound.' Of the
slaves, one who personates the overbearing Saurea, truculentis
oculis (v. 401), has the heroic name Leonidas, the other by
ironical contrast as a mild-mannered man, ‘quasi mollis et
elegam a thure, dicitur Libanus.’

1t is not often that we know the names of both the poet ancl
the play upon which a Plautine comedy is based. The main
