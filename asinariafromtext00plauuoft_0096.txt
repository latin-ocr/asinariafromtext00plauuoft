tions have been suggested. The
best is ni hodie A rgyrzppo uiginti
essent argenti minae (Pylades).
Ussing suggests adessem, keeping
the MSS. order.

366. dixit sese operam pro-
miscam dare, ‘he said that he
would help us in either case‚' i.e.
whether we tried to cheat Saurea
or Artemona. Promissam is a
correction by Palmer of the MSS.
promissam, adopted by Fleckeisen,
Leo, Goetz‚ Sne. But Ussing
keeps promissam, and the change
is not necessary.

dixit sese dare for dixit se
daturum esse is Plautine. Cf. v.
442. We find the pres. instead of
future infin. aster promittere (as v.
377 promitto hostire), very fre-
quently with dare (Brix finds only
3 instances of the fut. with dare);
after sperare (as v. 699), also after
iurare, adiurare, uouere, minari,
interminari. With dixit of this
line and aibat of v. 442 followed
by pres. infin.‚ cf. Pseud. 1117 me
aibat arcessere ‘he said that he
would send for me,' Capt. 194 ire

He'rcle uero tu cauebis ne‘ me attingas, si sapis,

dixeram,
rare?

370. oble-ctam, ‘I will play
him off,’ ‘keep him amused’:
‘blandis uerbis relz'nebo’ Lambi-
nus. See on v. 142 and cf. Ter.
Hec. 84 dic mi, ubi te oblectasti
lam din .? ’

371. quid ais? ‘ 1 say, ’ a stand-
ing formula to attract a person’s
attention before asking him a
question and generally answered
by quid uis? ‘what do you want?'
See on v. 104. Leonidas warns
Libanus that he means to play
the part of Saurea to the life and
asks him not to mind the blows
he must give him in doing so.
fllalam -· maxillam.

372. The MSS. give mox quom
Sauream imitabor caueto with an
awkward hiatus. Fleckeisen trans-
poses imitabor Sauream, and is
followed by Ussing. But 1 have
adopted without hesitation Leo's
brilliant in Sauream mutabor and
have divided caueto into caue tu,
as proposed by Bentley. Cf. Capt.
431 caue tu mi iratus suas.
