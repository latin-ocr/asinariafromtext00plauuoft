Asinos, si forte occeperint clamare hinc ex crumina.

quod (Mil. 469) is in accordance
with later usage. But aster verbs
of feeling (doleo, gaudeo, succenseo
826.) Plautus commonly prefers
quia. See Brix on Trin. 290. Thus
contrast with the present passage
Mil. 103 5 me inclamato, quia sic te
uolgo uolgem.

⁶⁸4. This line is bracketed by
Mulier, and by fleckeisen is placed
after v. 581. 1 have left the bracket
as printed by Goetz and Schoell,
but do not think it necessary.
Langen, Plautinische Studien, p.
10, defends the line, but trans-
poses it.

memoriter, ‘with accurate me-
mory.’ See Madvig De Finibus
1. 10. 34. Cf. Amph. 417, Capt.
2 o.

⁵585. medum: μένε δή. Cs.
dicdum = λέγε δή, primum dum
ετρῶτον δή, ᾳαίᾶιιηιεπῶς δή;
The hiatus after Philaenium is
legitimam, but that aster quae is
harsh. To avoid it Mulier reads
isthaec, Ussing illaec.

58⁶. The mette is disturbed
hene. The simplest plan is to omit

una, as proposed by XVeise, Us-
sing, and Reiz.

The lovers come in tears out
of Cleareta's house. Philaenium
clings to Argyrippus and will not
let him go.

58⁷. lacinia tenet, ‘uidelicet
Philaenium retinet Argyrlpputtt
abeuntem.’ Lacinia, ‘by the lap-
pet of his cloak (pallium).' Cs.
Merc- 126 at tu edepol sume laci-
niam el absterge sudorem tibi.

588. attam, or attat, an ex·
pression os surprise as a fresh
thought has just occurred to him.
ἅτταται τὸ δεῖνα. ‘bless me! it has
just occurred to me.'

590. amos, ⁴ i.e. nummos pro
asinis uenditis solutos unde nomen
fabulae.’ Leonidas tapping his
money-bag says he wishes he had
a stick to beat the asses with in
case they begin to bray. There is
the same joke on the same comic
confusion of animals and the price
paid for them Pers. 264 amico
homini bobus domitis mea ex cru·
mina larg-ior, and Truc. 646 oues
illius haud longe absunt a lupis.
