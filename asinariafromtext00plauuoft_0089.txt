lighter nor heavier than it ought
to be. Centumpondium occurs
also Cato R. R. 13 tin.

305. nee dependes nec pro·
pendes, δὶα, ⁸ you are neither
too light nor too heavy, for a
pure rogue and raseal.’ Propen-
deo is to ‘hang forward‚' ‘hang
down‚⁸ used of the scale pullecl
down by the heavy weight. Cic.
Tusc. v. 17. 51 tantum propen-
dere illam lancem putat, ut terram
et maria deprimat, ibid. v. 3¹· 86
si bona propendent.

qun malus nequamque sis,
lit. ‘so as to prevent your being a
rogue and raseah' is added παρὰ.
προσδοκίαν.

306. hoc testamento Seruitus
legat tibi, ‘that (zuae tibi, con-
found you Σ) is the legacy Slavery
bequeaths to you! Weise reads
istoc to avoid hiatus, but as there
is a change of speakers the hiatus
is permissible. Otherwise istoc,
‘that of yours‚‘ ‘what you say,'
is a most suitable pronounl. Cf.
Mil. 327 Sc. uae capiti tuo ΡΑ.
tuo istuc, Sceledre, promitto fore,
Amph. 741 A. uae capiti tuo So,
tua istuc refert, si curaueris, Rud.

tuae ΤΚ. tuo, mea Ampelisca.

307. uerbi uentationem fleri
conuentu uolo, ‘a truce to this
war of words.’ Verbi is gen. of
definition‚=an adj„ with uelita-
tionem, ‘light-skirmishing con-
sisting of wortls'=·wor(ly war.’
Cf. Men. 780 nescio quid uos ueli-

Verbi[s]uelitationem sieri compendi uolo:
Tutumst cre'dere?

Li. Au-

tati estis inter uos duo, Hdt. vul.
64 ἔπεσι ἀκροβολισάμενοι, ibid.
Vlu. 78 λόγων ὠθισμός. compendi
fieri is the passive of compendi
facere, ‘to cut short‚' as Pseud.
1141 operam sace compendi quae-
rere. ‘make short work of your
search,’ Most. 57 orationis operam
compendi sace, Bacch. 183 com-
pendi uerba multa iam faciam tibi.
In the phrase compendi facem, com-
pendi is the ‘contained’ genitive.
i.e. probably a locative like the
gen. of price. as in lucri facere.
praemii, mercedis, dotis dare.

308. quid istud negotist? ¹ what
is that business os yours?‘ is clearly
the first part os the line: credere
audacter licet as clearly the end.
The common reading in the middle
is LE. certumst credere? to which
Libanus replies audacter licet. But
certumst (=decreui as in v. ²48) is
utterly inappropriate here. Two
alternatives seem to be open to us,
(ι) with Ussing to read quid istud
tibi negoti exortumst? C redere au-
dacter licet, the whole line being
assigned to Libanus, (2) with Rib-
beck and Pros. Palmer to read
(Ll.) Quid istud negotist? LE. tu·
tumst credere? L1. audacter licet.
i.e. ⁴ what is that business os yours?’
‘is it safe to trust you?’ ‘yeS. you
may with confidence.' This is the
better course, though even so the
line is not metrically satisfactory.
Bentley would transpose quid istud
est negoti? Ribbeck inserts dic at
the beginning. For audacter licet
