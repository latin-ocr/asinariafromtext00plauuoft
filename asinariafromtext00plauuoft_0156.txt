Pater,

I'lle ecastor suppilabat me, quod ancillas meas
suspicabar atque insontis miseras cruciabam.

the whole line, cs. Men. 134 lzanc
modo uxori intus pallam surrupui:
ad scortum sero. The ἄ of rapere,
capere, quatere, calcare, salire be-
comes originally zZ in compounds
(Cmssen, Aussprache 1. 314). See
Brix on Trin. 83, Munro on Lucr.
111. 1031.

885. in deliciis pallam quam
habet. The order is subrupz'am
pallam quam in deliciis habet.
quero and degero are almost tech-
nical terms for conveying presents
to a mistress.

886. non edepol conduci pos-
sum uita uxoris annua, ‘1 cannot
be hired (not to do it) ifmy wifedies
within the year.⁷ Sensus: ‘si quis
milti spondeat fore ut mea uxor
intra annum moriatur)

Ussing takes a different view of
the whole passage. He under-
stands ne to be confirmatiua and
regards the whole speech (ego ne. ..
annua) as one sentence, ‘Verily 1
cannot be bribed...so as not to
steal‚' ἃς. In this view F. Leo
and Minton XVarren (Amer. Journ.
of Phil. 11. 54) concur.

Further he regards uita annua
as a long rather than a short
period, and thinks that Plautus
would have said morte not uita, if
the common view had been cor-

890

rect. Annuus=‘for a year’ as
annuos penus Pseud. 178, annuis
copiis Tac. Agric. 22. The ana-
logy of similar sentences seems to
me conclusive in favour os taking
ne to be interrogatiua, and there·
fore v. 886 as a separate sentence.
Vita uxoris annua is in any case
a παρὰ προσδοκίαν joke, and to a
henpecked husband like Demae—
netus uita annua would be a corn-
paratively early release from the ⁷
yoke under which he chased.

887. ganeum (also ganea) a low
‘cook-shop,’ in bad repute as the
resort of low characters. Cf.
Men. 703 inmersit aliquo sese
credo in ganeum.

888. quod ancillas meas sus-
picabar. I prefer to take quod as
accus. of limitation (a usage in
which quod, quid, id. idem are
very common in Plautus, see e.g.
Epid. 131) rather than to supply

facere.

889. cruciabam. Slaves were
examined under torture, and it was
only when they were put upon the
rack that any weight was attached
to their evidence. v

890. iam dudum factumst
quom, ‘it is now long since.' Cf.
v. 251, Roby L. G. 1725.
