exceptions are the T rz'nummus from Philemon's Θησαυρός, the
Mostellaria from his Φάσμα, the Mercator from his Ἕμπορος, the
Casina from his Κληρούμενοι, the Bacchides from the Δὶς ἐξα-
πατῶν, and the Poenulus from the Καρχηδόνιος of Menander.
This makes it the more provoking that when we are told the
Asinaria is drawn from the Ὀναγὸς of Demophilus we know
nothing of Demophilus himself. The play leaves no doubt that
he was a poet of the New Comedy. Fleckeisen (Annal. phil.
XCVII. p. 213) finds traces of his name in a list of New Comedy
writers found at the Piraeus. Of the first name on the list
there remain the letters A}....102‚ i.e. Δημόφιλος. See Ussing,
Ι. 352. But this is not generally accepted.

12. T lle T ext (gf tlze Asinaria. The great Plautine codex at
Milan, the famous Ambrosian Palimpsest, A, does not in its
present condition contain the Asinaria, or the other plays
(Amphitruo and Aulularia) that stood first. So we have not
its help in the text of the play.

B, the ‘codex vetus’ (formerly in the Palatine Library at
Heidelberg, now in the V atican) of the 11th cent. contains all
20 plays.

C, the ‘codex decurtatus' (Heidelberg, 12th cent.) contains
the last 12 plays only.

D, codex Ursinianus or Vaticanus, 12th cent., contains like C
which it closely resembles the last 12 plays with the addition of
the Amphitruo, Asinaria, Aulularia, and half the Captivi.

E, codex Ambrosianus of the 13th cent. has the first eight
plays including the Asinaria, as has J, the British Museum MS.
assigned by Ritschl to the 11th cent., by Goetz and Loewe to
the 12th.

The MSS. then in which the Asinaria stands are B, D, E, J,
and F1. The extant MSS. present two different recensions of
the text. A is the representative of one ε BC the best exponents
of the other. The ‘Palatine’ text (BC) often varies greatly
froin the ‘Ambrosiam' and possesses a high independent value.
