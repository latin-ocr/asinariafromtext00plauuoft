qui mest uir fortior ad sufferundas plagas?
Edepol uirtutes qui tuas non possis conlaudare,

Sicut ego possim, quae' domi duellique male fecisti.

Ne illa e'depol pro merito
possunt:

tionis inducere. Ussing would
have z'mpactores or some such
word, but the joke is quite in the
style of slaves' humour, and it is
impossible to misunderstand it
with the explanatory words that
follow, ‘painters—keen as can be
and acquainted with our backs‚⁷
i.e. who know from previous ex-
perience just where it will hurt
most. There are many allusions
in Plautus to the colours produced
by a flogging, eg. Rud. iooofiet
tibi puniceum corium, postea atrum
denuo, Pseud. 229, Epid. 17, &a

552. An unmetrical line and
a manifest gloss on the previous
words.

554. The torments and tormen-
tors, by one of the frequent mili-
tary metaphorS‚ are represented
as an army routed in the field.

555. ui pugnando. modal abl..
cf. Amph. 414 legiones T eleboarum
ui pugyzando cepimus, Men. 1054
teque eripio uipugnandm z'tzgrratiz's.

periuriis nostris is instrum.
abl.

fugae potiti, sc. sunt, i.e. ‘have
been put into the possession of
rout,' ‘ have fallen into the hands of
defeat.' As Plautus uses an active
form, eg. Amph. 178 eum nunc
petiuit pater seruitutis, it is not
surprising to find potiti passive.
Fugae is Buecheler’s correction of

[nunc] tuo memorari multa

560

euge E, eugae BD. In the pre-
vious line forum is given for
eorum, and Aul. 667, Most. 674
fuge for euge.

556. id. uirtute hutus couegai.
So Seyffert for collegae, avoiding
thereby a transposition. Cf. co-
moediai (Mil. 84), sapientiai (Mil.
237) and see the list given by Brix
on Trin. 359. He speaks of Leo-
nidas as if he were joint—com-
mander with him of an army. So
also v. 576. Aleaque comitate, ‘my
kind assistance‚' cf. Mil. 79. ⁷

558. edepol uirtutes qui tuas
non possis conlaudas-e, ‘egad you
could not praise your valorous
deeds, as Ι could your misdeeds,’
ἃς. qui is enclitic with edepol, cf.
v. 505: non Gertz for nunc. Goetz
and Schoell retain nunc with a
mark of interrogation, i.e. ‘how
could y0u‚'4&c. Leo writes non
potis es, but I prefer possis as the
MSS. reading, and believe the mis-
understanding of qui has led to
the difficulty.

559. quae domi duemque male
fecisti, ‘your misdeeds at horne
and abroad.‘ Scan du—ellique as
Capt. 68 domi duellique dzZ’llatores
optumi. Dgcellum, old form of
bellum, is generally by synizesis
dissyllabic in Plautus. Cf. dgcis
(bis) and dgconoro (bonorum).

560. ne illa. edepol. See on
