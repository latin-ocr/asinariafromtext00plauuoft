many points necessitates osten a very wide departure from and
extensive modification os the French playwright’s work1. The

4. Text. The text of Plautus depends on MSS. of three
classes. In the first class stands a single MS. A, the famous
Ambrosian Palimpsest—the oldest Latin M S. extant—now in the
Ambrosian Library at Milan. It is dated as belonging to the
4th or 5th cent.‚ but the codex was separated and written over
by a monkish scribe in the 7th or 8th cent.‚ and now there
sut-vives about a third part of the leaves with the original
Plautine text under the Vulgate of the monk. Imperfect and
difficult to decipher as even this temnant is, it is of supreme
importance sor the text of Plautus. Nothing is left of the
Amphitruo, Asinaria, Aulularia, Curculio, little of the Captivi,
Cistellaria, Vidularia3 of the other plays altogether about
half is extant, but in different proportions, so that of the
Pseudolus and Stichus little is wanting3 less than half is lost
of Casina, Persa, Poenulus; about half of Epidicus and Tri-
nummus; more than half of the Bacchides, Mostellaria, Me-
naechmi, Mercator, Miles Gloriosus, Rudens, Truculentus. The
MS. was discovered by Cardinal Mai 1815—an Apograph has
been published by W. Studernund.

In the second class fall four MSS. proceeding from one source:
(1) Vetus Codex of Camerarius (Joachim Camerarius 1 5 58) of
the 11th cent.‚ formerly in the Palatine Library at Heidelberg,
since 1622 in the Vatican Library at Rome. It contains all
20 plays, and is referred to after Ritschl as B.

(2) Codex alter of Camerarius, usually described as Decurtatus
and marked C (12th cent.). It contains the 12 last plays, was
at Heidelberg and Rome with Β, but was taken to Paris 1797,
and at the Restoration to Heidelberg.

(3) Ursinianus or Vaticanus—mm cent—contains like C,
which it closely resembles, the last 12 plays with Amphitruo,
Asinaria, Aulularia, and half the Captivi. This MS. was brought
