Cdnsuadent: certum herclest nostram consequi sententiam.
sed quid hoc, quod picus ulmum tundit? haud teme-

rariumst.

Certe hercle ego quantum ex augurio <eius> pici intellego,
Aut mihi in mundo sunt uirgae aut :itriensi Saureae.
Sed quid illuc, quod exanimatus currit huc Leonida?

Metuo quom illic obscaeuauit meae salsae fallaciae.

2⁶1. eertum herclest nostram
eonseqm sententiam, ”gad I'm
determined to follow your advice.‘
spoken as if addressed directly to
the birds. Consequi=sequi Amph.
880, Rud. ²41 and 493.

262. sed quid hoc? ‘but what’s
this?' ‘what’s the meaning ofthis?²
an expression of surprise at some
unexpected or unwelcome sight
(Mil. 1344, Pseud. 22, Epid. 344),
more common without than with
est. Cf. v. 265.

quod picus ulmum tumut. The
ξςὲτὲίῗῇεὸεὲῗίέῗέιῗῑῖῐξῗεε. 18ἓίιῖἎῖ
is tapping an elm, ‘the birch-rod
of the ancients‚' and this was omi·
nous. ⁸ Vlmus unde uirgae ‚fiebant
quibus uapulahant serui. Cf.
Epid. 3¹¹ and 626.

haud. temerariumst (haud No-
nius p. 414, non codd.)‚ ‘it's not
for nothing,’ i.e. it has a meaning,
cf. Au]- 184 non temerat-iamsi. ubi
diues blande appellat pauperem:
elsewhere non or haud temere est,
as Aul. 624 quoted on v. 260. So
non sorte, haud frustra. C f.
Epid. 714.

263. ex augurio elus 1:101. B
has ex augurio auspicii, DE aus-
pini, Camerarius proposed ex au-
gurio auspicioque and most editors
have followed him. But the
change is for the worse3 the two
words are little more than a tau-
tology, and, is that cannot be con-

sidered conclusive in comic diction,
there certainly is a defining geni-
tive required. To me Gertz’s cius

pici seems as certain as it is bril-

liant. Ussing (⁸uerum inuenit
Gerlzius') adopts it, Leo has huius
pici, which is the same thing and
not so close to the emended word.
But Loewe·G‹1etz ‘ueremur ut sis
recle Latine dicatur)

264. 111 mundo sunt uirgae,
‘there are rods in pickle either for
me or Saurea.’ Libanus iuterprets
the tapping of the elm to portend
uirgae ulmeae for himself or Sau-
rea, as he shall fail or succeed.
in mundo, a substantivised neut-
adj. from mundus, in this phrase
only, = ‘in a state of neatness,’ i.e.
all clean and ready, hence used
for paratus. Cs. v. 316, Stich.
477, Epid. 618. Pers. 46.

atriensi, ‘atrio propositus alque
adeo totius domus quasi procurator
quidam‚’ Ussing: ‘major-domo.’
Cf. Pseud. 609, PS. condus promus
sum, procurator peni. HA. quasi
le dicas atriensem. ΡΒ. immo
atriensi ego impero.

265. sed quid mue? See v.
262. The running up of Leonidas
out of breath to Libanus is a token
that he has news, and aster the
clm-omen Libanus sears it must
be bad news.

266. metuo quom. The Mss.
give metuo quod here and Mil.
