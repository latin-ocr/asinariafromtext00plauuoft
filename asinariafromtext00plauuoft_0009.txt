PREFACE.

Tffls edition of the Asinaria is written on the same
principles as the Epidicus published in the same series
last year. But in so far as questions of text and reading
are more sully discussed this book may be considered a
little more advanced. The Epidicus was meant to be read
as a first play. This is intended for those who have already
worked through the Epidicus or some similar play.

The first nine sections of the Introduction have been
reprinted from the Epidicus, at the request of the Syndics of
the Press, to make the book more complete. The sect10ns
10—15 only were written with special reference to this play.

The text is based upon the recently issued volume by
Goetz and Schoell in the new Teubner edition. Some five
and thirty slight alterations have been made, all, I hope,
sufficiently explained in the notes. From Goetz and Schoell
are taken the very convenient signs,

[ ] to mark letters or words given by the MSS. but
not wanted.

( ) to enclose verses that have been foisted into the
text.

<> for letters or words not given by the MSS. but
required.

Ι to call attention to hiatus, remarkable but not
necessarily inadmissible.
