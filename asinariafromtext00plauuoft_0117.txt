not the abstract quality ‘astute-

54⁷. scapularum confidentia,
‘the impudence of our shoulders.’
Confidens in Plautus generally in
a bad sense, ‘bmen·saced,’ ‘sels-
assured,’ and confide-nna ‘sels-as-
surance.’

ummo ulmorum tren. ‘rely-
ing on the mettle os the birch.'
This phrase has occasioned much
discussion. Lambinus considers the
meaning so impossible that he
would alter to uirtute umerorum.
Ussing suggests uirtute ulmorum
spreta. But it is of the essence
os comedy to put the thing the
wrong way on, and while in
tragedy it might be necessary to
say uirtute umerorum freti, it is
quite in keeping with comic idiorn
to say uirtute ulmorum freti. It
may be pointed out that umerorum
would be a tautology after scapu-
larum.

there is no sign, except the relative

there is no lacuna. a principal
