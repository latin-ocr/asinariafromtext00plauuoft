Vt tibi superstes uxor aetatem siet
Atque illa uiua uiuos ut pestem oppetas.

Comedy Mommsen reeognises the
Catonian oppositiou to women, as
in the cudgelling of slaves he re-
cognises the household-government
inculcated by Cato, 11. p. 435.

At this period the emancipation
of women began. By old custom
a married woman was subject to
the marital power which was
parallel with the paternal: the
wife had no property of her own,
the virgin and widow had at any
rate no power of management. But
women began to aspire to inde—
pendence in respect of property...-
They took the management of
property into their own hands, or
in the event of being married
sought to withdraw themselves
from the marital power, which
under the strict letter of the law
was necessaly. Mommsen 11.
p. 408.

Artemona is one of these ladies
who manages her own property,
and terrorises her husband. Cf.
the complaints of Periphanes about
his wife, Epid. 180, ΑΡ. pulcra
edepol dos pecunz‘ast. PE. quae
quidem pol non maritast.

20. med erga.. Anastrophe of
the preposition is most common
with dissyllabic prepositions, erga,
penes, inter, and especially propter.
But it is not uncommon in Plautus
with monosyllables in, ad, ab, ex.
See instances quoted Epid. 170.

21. aetatem, acc. of duration
‘a whole lifetime.' Cf. v. 274
aetatem uelim seruire, Ter. Hec.

747 nam neque ille lzoc animo erit
aetatem ‘he won't keep that mind
his whole life) Cf. Ion of Chios
frag. 1. 15 χαῖρε· δίδου δ’ αἰῶνα,
καλῶν ἐπιήρανε ἔργων, πίνειν καὶ
παίζειν καὶ τὰ. δίκαια φρονεῖν.

22. ma uiua, abl. ‘and that
with h’er alive you may die a living
death.

pestem oppetas. Cf. Capt. 520
and the poet quoted by Cic. Tusc.
11. 16. 38 priusquam oppeto malam
pestem3 oppetere is used only in
malam partem of encountering evil
and death.

23. per DIum Hdium (deum
codd„ corr. Hermolaus) ‘you ask
rne by the god of truth &e.’
Falsus (fides) is more familiar in ⁷
the asseveration medius fidius, i.e.
ita me dius fidius amet, e.g. Plin.
Epist. IV. 3. 5 Hominemne Roma-
num tam Graece loqui? Non me-
dius fidius ipsas Athenas tam
Atticas dixerim. For dius, dies,
fio, fiunt )( dmm, nudius, fi‘erz'
ἃς. see Miiller Hdb. 11.² 279.

The two lines 23—24 are bracket-
ed by Fleckeisen and other editors
after him. The objection that
Demaenetus says quaeris, whereas
the word used is obtestor, seems
hypercritical. However as Ussing
says (p. 355) ‘even with the ex-
cision of these lines the speech is
prolix enough.’

25. ita me &c., ‘you have
attacked me with such determi-
nation that I do not dare to resuse
to disclose everything in answer to
