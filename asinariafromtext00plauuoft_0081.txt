Iam diust factum, quom discesti db ero atque abi<i>sti

AcT 11, Ser-:NE 1 (249—266).
Libanus returns reproaching him-
self because he has not yet devised
a plan for getting the money.

Septenarian trochaics continued
up to v. 380.

The soliloquy reads like a
parody on a tragic monologue.

250. It is impossible to keep
both v. 250 and v. ²52· Fleckei-

needless to discuss this ‘apodotic'
use os igitur, e.g. Mil. 772 quando
habebo, :gitur ralioncm mearum

fabricarum da bo.

253. 1b1=in soro, i.e. it refers
to adfhrum in v. 251, a further in-
dication that v. ²5² is an intruder.

dreaming.’ Bacch. ²40 haud dor-
