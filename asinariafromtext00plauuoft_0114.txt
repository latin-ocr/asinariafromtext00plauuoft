Quotiens te uotui Argyrippum filium Demaeneti
Compellare aut contrectare conloquiue aut contui?

Quid dedit? quid deportari iussit ad nos? an [tu] tibi 524
Ve'rba blanda esse aurum rere, dicta docta pro datis?
Vltro 311135, ultro expetessis‚ ultro ad te accersi iubes:

cheon with which the boatswain
beat time for the rowers. See Fes-
tus p. ²34 b. Nonius, p. 151,
quotes Ennius, Ann. Vll. 37 pare-
rent, absentarent portisculu’ sig-
num cum dare coepisset, and La-
berius, Cythera, nec palmarum
pulsus nec portisculi, ‘the beat
of neither blade nor baton.'

519. casteria. Philaenium con-
tinues the nautical metaphor sug-
gested in portisculum. Not only
is she willing to obey: nay more, if
she stops work to rest the whole
household comes to a standstill,
because supplies cease to coine in.
Nonius p. 85 defines casteria as
locus ubi, cum ›muzgratz'o conquiescit,
remi et gubernacula conquiescunt.
Hence it is translated ‘sail-r001n.'
But, as Ussing points out, Philae—
nium compares herself not to the
oars but the rowers, and she would
rest not where the oars are stowed‚
but where the crew rest. So he
takes casteria ε κατάστρωμα, ‘deck.'

521. quid ais tu? See on ν.

unam audacissumam. Vnus
is thus used to heighten a superla-
tive, Amph. 677 quam omnium
Thebis uir unam esse optumam
diiudicat, Capt. 278 quod genus
z'llz'st unum pollens alque honora-
tissummo, Mil. 52 te unum in

faclz's inuiclissumum.

523. conloquiue aut centul.
Ussing's note is (ἷζε, aut colloqui)
This Langen (Beitr‘age, pp. 95—-
99) attacks. Ve in Plautus, except
in union. with si, in siue or seu,
has no disjunctive force. In the
Plautine diction its significance is
neither disjunctive nor copulative:
the two things or thoughts con·
nected by it aye coexistent‚ e.g.
v. 636 uiginti minae quid pollent‘
quidue possunt, ‘the power and
might of 20 minae! There is a
disjunction in the thought only so
far as the two facts need not ne-
cessarily coexist. Cleareta has
forbidden her daughter just as
much conpellare, as contrectare,
35 conloqui, as contui, and 5ο far
ue retains its copulative soree. But
the actions may be viewed sepa-
rately‚ as well as collectively‚
hence aut before cantui is jus-
tified.

524. deportari is almost tech-
nical of sending presents to a mis-
tress' house.

525. rere, as generally pre-
ferred to reris. ‘Do you think
winning words are gold, proven
prover bs presents?' Dicta docta are
‘wit and wisdom‚’ Trin. 380 multa
ego possum docta dzkta quamuis
