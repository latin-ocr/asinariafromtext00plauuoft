an iambus. The combinations of words where this shortening
takes place commence with a monosyllable‚ or a dissyllable with
the second vowel elided, followed by a syllable properly long,
eg. qu6d in manu, abi Tn malam rem, ego 6bsonabo, &c.²

This shortening process depends entirely upon popular pro-
nunciati0n‚ which it reflects. lt is not a poetic licence‚ not
dependent upon the laws of metre.

The shortening of finals properly long must have been helped
by the influence of the expiratory accent in Early Latin.

Β. Lengthening of short syllables.

Plautus preserves the original length of a number of termi-
nations that became regularly short by the time of the Augustan
poets.

Thus es (sum) is regularly long in Comedy.

So often the termination or in comparatives, as auctior, sub-
stantives‚ amor, verbs, fateor, parficles, ecastor.

He keeps long, where it suits him, conjugation-endings in
s and t, as eris, eget, especially in the subjunctive, sit, fuat, veIIt,
in the perf. vixst, fult, and the exact-future adduxerit.

Third-declension ablatives are often long when written e, as
well as when written i, e.g. rete, carne, ordine, milite.

Ego has 6 often—mihi, tibi, sibi often, modo sometimes,
immo always.

As might be expected there is some licence in dealing with
Greek words. Acheruns is scanned with the first syllable long.
Therapontigonus, Curc. 430, has the second syllable long. tra-
pezita often has the first syllable long—perhaps we should in
such cases with Ritschl write tarpessita.

Greek proper names with ll are sometimes shortened, as
Callicles. Adjectives properly in aeus (=Greek -atos which is
sometimes -αἵος) can be written eus and scanned eus, and
schema=ff>0⁶7ua is in Amph. 117 schema.

C. Vowels added and Synizesis.
