PROLOGVS

Hoc figite sultis, spectatores, nunciam:
Quaequide'rn mihi atque uobis res uortat bene

Prologus. This Prologue, like
all the extant Prologues except
those to the Aulularia, Rudens
and Trinummus, is post-Plautinc
and belongs to the 7th cent. A.U.c.
On this and the Prologues gene-
rally see Introduction, p. xxxiv.

The Prologue was not delivered
by one of the characters of the
play, but by an actor in the special
dress appropriate—ornatu prologi.
The lines merely inform the au-
dience of the history os the piece
and bespeak their favour.

1. hoc agite, ‘attend to the
business in hand ’—t0 the exclusion
of everything else, i.e. ‘give this
your whole attention ' )( aliud agite.
The term is properly sacrificial
and used to call attention to the
ritas about to be commenced. Cf.
Suet. Calig. 58, Plutarch.Coriolan.
25. Hence hoc age, lzoc agile be-
comes ‘solemm's locutio, ubi ali-
quem attendere uolunt et stren ue rem
propositam agere' (NVeise), e.g.

spectatores. The audiencecome
from home at the beginning os the
piece (Poen. 10) and return home
at its close (Epid. Pseud. Rud.
Stich. Truc. ad fin.). Hence we
infer that only one piece was pro-
duced each day. They went to
the theatre aster the second break-
fast and were at home again for
dinner. The persormance thus
lasted srorn about noon till hals-
past two, and a play os Plautus
with music in the intervals between
the acts would probably oceupy
about that length os time. Tacitus
(Ann. xlv. 20) is referring to a
much later date.
