eccam=ecce eam. So eccum:
ecce eum, eccillum, eccistam &a
If as here there is a main verb
these words are interjected with-
out affeeting the construction. But
if there is no verb the ecce governs
acc. throughout. See on Epid.

The long narrow Roman stage
had a fixed background, viz. the
frontage of adjacent houses with
an angiportus between them. In-
teriors were not shewn. All in-

houses. So Cleareta now comes

by Philip os Macedon when he ac-
quired the gold mines os Thrace.
They became current all over the
world. They passed into currency
at Rome where under the Republie
there was no gold currency. Φιλίπ-
πειοι appears no doubt in the Ὀνα-
’γος here, but it is interesting to
note that the coins first came to
Rome at the time of the Macedo-
nian VVar and are first mentioned
by Livy at the date os the triumph
os Flaminius ¹95 ΚΟ.. the year
before this play was written. The
coin is continually mentioned by
Plautus, Bacch. ²30 and ι 183‚Trin.
