JA'TRODUCTJON. xix

x was written for cs but position was neglected, ex, exercitus,
senex, sutor.

ps does not necessarily lengthen a preceding vowel, Ipse, abs,
abscessi (Epid. 237), abstulisti, διε.

Like m, n followed by a consonant need not lengthen its
syllable, tamen, in compounded with verbs, δια, incedere, {n-
genium, Indiligenter‚ Tnprudens (Epid. 729). So n is neglected
in itan tandem, viden scelestus, Sec.

Nor need a vowel followed by nt be long, whether in 3rd pl.
in verbs, decent, student, solent, or elsewhere, ῐηωε, Interea,
iuventus. So ante once Capt. 243, inde, finde frequently.

r final does not help to make a vowel long by position-nor
always in the middle of a word, ergo, argentum, hercle, Ornatus.

Hicin all its cases and forms that end in c can be short,
at least when a short monosyllable precedes, qurs haec est, sed
quid huc, quid hunc sollicitas (Epid. 630).

d and t are neglected in etsi, tametsi, ut, at, ad, id, apud
(Epid. 53), in 3rd sing. of verbs before a consonant. Thus valet
pugilice, Epid. 20. Hence atque.

Brix points out that this shortening process only takes place
when the accent precedes the shortened syllable. Thus tene,
but c6ntine. And if there is a pause after such words, so that
the last syllable must be more emphasised than it would other·
wise be, the word usually has its proper length ; veni, iube,
pave, διε.

He confines shortening generally to syllables that precede
and follow that on which the accent falls, e.g. Epid. 21 volupta-
bilis, 418 administraret, 729 Inprudens, and so in the other
instances given above. '

In this Brix follows Corssen. Ussing denies that the
accent has any such force in Plautus. He considers that a
long syllable following a short is shortened by assimilation.
Whatever the explanation at least the fact remains (1) that the
shortened syllable must stand after a short one and is always
next—whether next before or next after—the aecem, (2) that the
shortening is most frequent in forms properly iambic and in
longer words and combinations of words* that commence with

2—2
