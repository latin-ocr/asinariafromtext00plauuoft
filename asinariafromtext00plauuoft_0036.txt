morality, and, to our notionS, flagrant in its bad taste. It would
be happily impossible to put such a scene upon a modern stage,
although the want of reticence, which seems to mark the time,
has led to the stage-treatment of some sufficiently startling
themes. The morality is gross and the taste is bad, and the moral
expressed by the Caterva at the close ‘implies less sympathy
with outraged virtue than with the disappointed delinquent.'—

Hic senex siquid clam uxorem suo animo fecit uolup,
lVeque nouom neque mirum ficit nec secus quam aliz· solent.

Yet after all we need not take it too seriously. Plautus was
not a moralist. His main object was to amuse. In this he has
succeeded admirably, but has chosen for comic treatment at the
close of the play a subject too serious and too offensive, judged
by our standards‚ for such light handling. Yet at least he has
not glorified vice, he has only laughed at it. As Prof. Sellar
puts it (Roman Poets of the Republic, p. 162) ‘Plautus writes
in the spirit of an ingennus in good-humoured sympathy with
the mass of the citizens, and with no feeling of bitterness to-
wards the aristocracy‚ or indeed to any human being whatso-
ever. He is at home with all kinds of men, except the highest
in rank. He takes a good-natured ironical delight in his slaves,
courtesans‚ parasites‚ and sycophants. He is not shocked by
anything they can do or say. He feels the enjoyment of a man
of strong animal spirits in laughing at and with them. Even
the leno, the least estimable character in the repertory of ancient
comedy, he treats rather as a butt than as an object of de-
testation.’

From the Prologues to Terence (eg. Haut. 36) we learn that
a play was either stataria ‘quiet,’ or motoria ‘lively and
bustling.' Thus the Hauton Timorumenos is stataria, the
Eunuchus motoria. The Asinaria in the same way would be
Ιηοίσνίιῑ, the Captivi stataria.

11. Dramatis Personae. Like nearly all the plays of

Plautus, but unlike those of Terence and most of those of
Caecilius, the Asinaria has a Latin title, while the names os

the characters are Greek. As is so often the case the names
