fricares, ‘only that you rubbed my
knees so grudgingly‚' i.e. unwil-
lingly.

679. age sis tu in partem,
‘now please do you in turn': z'n
partem-:⁶⁸11 μέρει, see v. 916.

680. taceas, me spectes, ‘say
nothing, trust me,' i.e. Ι need no
hint from you, you may rely upon
me to play up to my part. On the
ordinary use of me specta and mc
uide see on v. 145· Langen, Bei-
tr'age p. 276, doubts the distinction
there drawn between thern. It
must be admitted that the nuance
here is ‘reassuring' rather than
‘threatening‚' and the mood can
hardly be made aecountable for
this. Still Ι believe Brix’s dis-
tinction to be sound, and it may
be pleaded that taceas, me spectes
is not quite the same as me specta.

bor immediately after congrediar,
Pers. 786 adgredibor. See Langen,
Beitr'age p. 84.

681. non similem furis hume,
‘not like this thief Leonidas.’

682. inambulandumst‚ ‘ I must
strut about.'

683. sis, i.e. si uis, contains the
protasis of the sentence, ‘if you
wish...give me,’ ἃς. See v. 309.

685. uidebitur, ‘it shall be
seen to,’ a phrase to give himself
importance without committing
himself to any promise. ‘Your
case shall be inquired into: come
back at such a time and we will
see what we can do for you.' In
the sense of putting off the consi-
deration of a question the fut. perf.
uidero is usual (Roby 1593), except
in the 1st pers. plur. (Roby ¹595)-
