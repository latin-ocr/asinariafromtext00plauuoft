498. nugi, commonly explain-
ed as predicative dative, is an adj.
of any gender, number or case.
Peculium is the special term for
the savings of a slave, e.g. Pseud.
ι 189 mea quidem haec habeo omnia,
meo peculio empta. His savings
could not be counted either (ι) be·
cause be had so much, or (2) be-
cause he had none. The spectators
would have no difficulty in under-
standing which he meant the Mer-
cator to understand, and which
really was the fact.

499. etiam nunc ‹nco- The
line is too long. Etiam is sound,
but what else should be read is
doubtful. Fleckeisen cuts out dico,
but nunc is not what we should
expect. Lachmann proposed hodie,
which accounts for the corruption
hodie, hoc die, nunc dico, but is liable
to the same objection as nunc.
Prof. Palmer anno, ‘last year,’ cs.
Amph.91. Perhaps horno, as Most.
155 uelut horno messis magna fuit.
This gives excellent sense and
accounts for the corruption as well
as anything so far proposed.

Rhodo, ‘from Rhodes! Cf.

cyntho, acch. 227, Poen. 999.

501. adnumeramt is shewn by
Langen (Beitrage. p. 93) to be the
right word. Cf. Merc. 88, Ter.
Adelph. 369.

502. ettam tu quoque. When
the words come in the order etiam
quoque they are separated by the
pronoun, but in the reverse order
quoque eliam they come together.
See Trin. 1048, Men. 1160, Epid.
254.

503. me is bracketed by Ussing
as having arisen from ME, the
letters denoting Mercator at the
beginning of the previous line :
percontari aliquem = quaerere cx
aliquo as v. 343. Ι believe Ussing
is ri ht.

‘1 should be sorry to deny it.'
On the form see v. 467.
