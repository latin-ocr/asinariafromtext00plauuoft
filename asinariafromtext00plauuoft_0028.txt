Penthernimeral is rnore common than hephthemimeral cae-
sura. Hiatus is most common at the caesura.

The T rochaz'c Septenarz'us (tetrameter trochaicus catalecti-
cus) was employed when the speech was important or exeited‚
and is used by Plautus with great effect. There is a diaeresis
after the 4th foot which should coincide with the end of a word.
This is occasionally neglected. A tribrach [vv-⁴] can be sub-
stituted for a trochee [—v], except in the 7th foot where it is
rare-a spondee can be used not only in 2nd‚ 4th and 6th (as in
Greek), but in lst‚ 3rd and 5th.

The Latin admitted a dactyl instead of a spondee, save in
the 4th foot, where it is rare. A dactyl is most common in the
first foot.

The Iambz'c Septenarius (tetrameter iambicus catalecticus)
is a favourite cornic mette. The treatment is the same as that
of the Senarius‚ except that, as there is a diaeresis aster the 4th
foot, that foot and the 7th ought to be pure. But tribrachs,
spondees and dactyls are found in the 7th foot.

Octonarz·z', iambic and trochaic (ie. tetrametri acatalectici>‚ are
used by Latin Comedians in highly excited scenes where great

bustle and haste are intended to be expressed. This is an ⁷

innovation‚ for Greek writers do not use these metres. The
diaeresis after the 4th foot is more often neglected in octonarii
than in septenarii. Trisyllabic feet are found in the 4th place,
the Sth foot is pure.

When the excitement has passed the octonarii usually pass
into another and quieter mette, generally trochaic septenarii.

A system of octonarii is terminated by a clausula (short
verse) of kindred metre, i.e. an iambic system will finish with
iambi, a trochaic with trochees.

Siinilar short lines are sometimes prefixed to systems.

Trochaic octonarii are seldom long-continued.

Anapaesls (generally acatalectic) are used by Plautus with
considerable licence. Thus a dactyl is followed by an ana-
paest‚ and a proceleusmatic substituted for an anapaest. The
anapaestic metre was difficult to observe accurately in Latin.

Other metres are Cretic [-v-], Paeona- [-.,.,.‚ or *vv-J]
