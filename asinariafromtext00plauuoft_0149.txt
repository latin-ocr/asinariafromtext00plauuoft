Ac‘r V, SCENE 1 (828—850).
Argyrippus, Demaenetus and Phil-
aenium feasting.

The scene is written in octona-
rian iambics: the first two lines
are senarii interpolated. The Ro-
man comic stage regularly repre-
sents an exterior. Yet here we
are shewn a glimpse of an interior,
enough at least to let the audience
see the three persons reclining at
table. Perhaps the open door
would shew all that is required
for this and similar banquet
scenes. The resources of the
Roman stage were unable to shew
an interior proper.

The lectus shewn is a triclinium.
Argyrippus is at the top, Demae-
netus in the middle and Philae-
nium at the bottom os the lectus.
See v. 891.

aas—9. These two lines are
spurious. The persons are already

seated at table, not about to take
their places there. The metre too
is against them. All editors sol-
lowing Weise bracket the lines.
Ribbeck supposes the lines to
belong to a gap between IV. 1
and IV. 2 where Diabolus sees
the preparations for the banquet.
But nothing is really lost there.
830. numquidnam tibi moles-
tumst? ‘you don't mind, do you,
&c.? ’ Cf. the polite formula si tibi
molestum non est, e.g. Epid. 461.
831. pietas. pater, oculis dolo-
rem prombet, ‘filial feeling,
father. keeps pain from my eyes‚'
i.e. takes the smart‚ the sting out
of the sight. ‘Veteres dicebant
ei oculos dolere, qui quod nollet
uideret! Cf. Ter. Phorm. 1053
uin facere quod tuo uiro oculi
dolatnt? Cic. Fam. vul. ¹4· ι
numquam tibi oculi doluissent, si in
repulsa Domitii uultum uidisses.
