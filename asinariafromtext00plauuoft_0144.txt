[IIII 1 778—786

Spectandum ne quoi εκ anulum det neque roget.
'l‘alos * ne quoiquam homini admoueat nisi tibi.

Quom iaciat, ‘te' ne dicat, nornen nominet.

780

Deam inuocet sibi quam lubebit propitiam,
Deum nullum: si magis religiosa ffierst,
Tibi dicat: tu pro illa ores ut sit propitius.
Neque illa ulli homini mitet nietet a'nnuat.

Post si lucerna extincta sit, nequid sui
Membri commoueat quicquam in tenebris.' D1.

tumumst :

778. ne quoi. Here again to
avoid hiatus Pylades and Ritschl
read quoiquam. She was not to
let anyone look at her ring or ask
to look at anyone’s ring, lest this
should be a pretext for pressing
her hand. Cf. Tibull. 1. 6. 25 saepe,
uelut gemmas eius sigyzumque prc-
barcm, per causam memini me teti-
gisse manum.

779. talos, for ‘dice' played at
table cf. Mil. 165, Most. 302, infr.
904.

780. ‘te' ne dicat, ‘let her not
say ‘le' but ‘Diabolzmz,' lest by a
mental reservation she should refer
to some one else. For ‘invoking'
the lover's name as the throw is
made cf. v, 905, Cure. 356,Capt. 73.

782. deum nullum, ‘let her in-
voke the favour of any goddess she
pleases. but no god.’ Diabolus is
too jealous to allow the name of
any male to pass Philaenium's lips.
She must not pray to a god because
ofhis sex. Like Properti11s‚u-e may
suppose Diabolus to say riualem
possum von egoserre leuem.

si magis relig-losa fuerit, ‘if
her religious scruples shall prove
too strong' (to allow her to live
without addressing any god) ‘let
her tell you, and do you address
the god on her behalf! Scan snm-it,

cf. fiiz'mus Capt. 262,szierz’m Mil.
1364,f7?erz'nt Poen. 1 10. The long
u is probably due to the analogy
of other verbs with short vowel
in pres. and long vowel in perf.

784. nutet metet annuat. N o-
nius, p. 439, distinguishes the
meaning of these words: ‘nutare
capitis, anmtcre uel innuere nari-
um uel labrorum, nictare oculorum
szgrnfficantiam esse? But the mean-
ing he assigns to annuere is too'
nari-ow. It is a more general word,
including the two first and any
other method of making signs, and
retains its usual sense of assenting.
See Stich. 224, Bacch. 186, Cure.
342· ‘Nor let her nod, wink, or
signify compliance to any man.'
Cf. what Mommsen calls the
charming line srom the Tarentilla
aliz· adnutat, alii adm'ctat: alium
amat, alium leuet.

786. quicquam aster nequid is
redundant, cf. Epid. 313, Mil. 432,
with Brix's note.

optumumst (not optumest) must
be read. Optnmumst,‘ it is excellent‚’
is an expression of satisfaction‚ ob-
jecfive, cf. Aul. 230, Truc. 626.
But optumest, bene est = καλῶς
exet: I'm comfortable or pleased,
sigbjective, cf. Capt. 699, Amph.
