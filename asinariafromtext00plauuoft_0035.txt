The play now turns to the fortunes of the girl. Her mother
upbraids her sor her partiality to Argyrippus and sorbids further
communication with him unless he comes money in hand (504—
544). Returning to the slaves we see them triumphant at their
success. Then meeting the lovers they tell Argyrippus they
have the money for him, but will not hand it over until they
have befooled both lovers in the wildest style. finally Argy-
rippus has to submit to carry the slave on his back, when
satisfied with their sport the slaves give him the purse and
explain how the scheme has been carried through (545—745).
Meanwhile the rival, Diabolus, with the aid of his Parasite,
has drawn up a bond regulating Philaenium's behaviour, when
she shall have become his on payment os the 20 minae. This
absurd document he reads sor the amusement of the audience
(746—809). But learning that he has been anticipated by
Argyrippus, Diabolus denounces the whole plot to Artemona
through the Parasite, who leads her to the banquet where father
and son are celebrating their success with Philaenium. Demae-
netus is ignominiously carried off by his wife, and Argyrippus
left in possession (tho—end).

edition, 1891, 1. p. 135) as having ‘a farcical plot, but varied and
lively characters and scenes of great comic power.’ The date
is 194 B.c.‚ so that the play belongs to the period of Plautus'
greatest activity‚ from which date the bulk of the plays that
have come down to us. The year is notable as the date at
which regular dramatic performances at the Megalensia com-
menced.

The play has reached us without mutilation. Ussing’s re-
mark is just ‘nisi quod turpitudo argumenti offendit, merito
laudatur3 nam et optime morata est et imprimis ridicula.’
The last scene which shews father and son practically vying
with one another sor Philaenium's attentioris is gross in its
