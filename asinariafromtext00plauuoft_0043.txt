INTRODUCTJON. xxxix

period comedies began to be written in Roman costume, the
part os the crasty servant had to be rejected, because the Roman
public did not tolerate slaves of this sort overlooking and con-
trolling their masters‘ (Mommsen, ii. 432).

There is no more striking proof that a foreign lise is being
presented in Roman Comedy than the fact that whencver it is
necessary to refer to a Roman law, a Roman custom‚ a Roman
poet, the Roman language. the thing is described in true Greek
style as ‘barbariam‘ See Asin. Prol. 11.

This very representation of a life foreign to the audience
imposed many restrictions on the adapter. He must perforce
cut out all characters that would be incomprehensible to an
ordinary Roman. He must trim the conversation, the dishes‚
the jokes down to the level of his hearers. These remarks may
serve to explain at once why the treatment of the originals is so
free and why the life described is so essentially un-Roman.

In one point of the treatment of slaves on the stage Momm-
sen sees the hand of the adaptet who is adding something out-
side his original. ‘ In the endless abundance of cudgelling and
in the lash ever suspended over the back of the slaves we
recognise very clearly the household government inculcated by
Cato, just as we recognise the Catonian opposition to women in
the never-ending abuse of wives’ (ii. 435). The criticism is
true is understood of the extent to which these things are dwelt
on-—not of their presence in the plays altogether.

The whole of Mommsen's two chapters on ‘Faith and Man-
ners' and ‘ Literature and Art' (ii. 394-479) deserve close
attention from the student of Roman Comedy.

Ribbeck, Rhein. Mus. 37, Spengel, die Akteinteilung der
Komodien des Plautus, Geppert and Langen, Plautinische
Studien, have pointed out inconsistencies in the development
of the plot. Some os these are real, but we must not expect
from Plautus the logical development of a play of Sophocles.
