ARG. Ego uero sequor.

GREx

Hic senex siquid clam uxorem suo animo fecit uolup,
Neque nouom neque mirum fecit nec secus quam alii

solent.

Ne‘c quisquamst tarn ingenio duro ne'c tam firmo pec-

tore,

Quin, ubi quicque occasionis sit, sibi faciat bene.

945

Nunc si uoltis deprecari huic seni ne uzipulet‚
Remur inpetrari posse, plausum si clarum datis.

slraxitque hominem in maxumam
malam crucem. Prof. l’almer sug-
gests in in crucem? i.e. isne in
crucem? cf. Merc. 182 in hinc
dierectus? Then Philaenium would
continue immo in tu potius?

941. immo potius intro, ‘nay
rather inside.’ [ntro Fleckeisen.
The MSS. give immo intuspolius‚but
intus for intro is a solecism. For
intus Niemeyer suggests in lectum,

haps this should be adopted.
Demaenetus angrily tells Philae-
nium ‘to go to the deuce.’ She
retorts ‘nay it is you who· are

rippus tells him to follow her.
Ussing brackets the line, but this
is a counsel of despair.

Langen, Plautinis-che Studien,
p. 105, notes that Philaenium’s
conduct in this last scene is in-
consistent with her previous cha-
racter. So far her genuine love
for Argyrippus has roused sym-
pathy, here she sinks to a common
drab.

GREX. The concluding lines
are delivered by the whole troupe
of actors. See v. 3 and note on
Epid. 732. The conclusion of the
Bacchides should be compared
with this passage.

942. uolup (Gk. Γελπ- in ἔλπομαι
Miiller Hdb. 11.‘-' ²57 and 277) is
used 15 times in Plautus and twice
in Terence like an adv. Donatus on
Ter. Phorm. 610 says uolnp .· uo-
lupe facul .· fiztz'le. Cf. Amph.

est. ibid. 278, te, Palaestrio, uolup

note. ‘If this old gentleman un·
known to his wife has done any-
thing to please his humour‚‘ Sec.
For the use of si where there is
no supposition, cf. Capt. 195, 198,

945. qum, ubi quicque ocea-
sionis sit, ‘as not, whenever there
is any chance, to do himself a good
turn.’ Cf. Amph. 1048 ubiquem-
