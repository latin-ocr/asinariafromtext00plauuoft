ASJNARJA 31

Diem aquam solem ltinam noctem, baec argento non emo:
Cetera quae uolumus uti Graeca mercamur fide.

Quom a pistore panem petimus, uinum ex oenopdlio, 200
Si aes habent, dant mercem: eadem nos discip<u>lina

utimur :

semper o[c]culatae manus sunt nostrae, credunt quod

uident.

Vetus est ‘nili coactiost ’—scis cuius: non dico amplius.
AR. Aliam nunc mi orationem despoliato praedicas,

199. cetera quae uolumus uti.
Unless we are prepared to allow
that the last syllable os cetera is
scanned long, there is a syllable
wanting. Various remedies have
been suggested quaeque (i.e. quac-
cunque), quae nos, sz' quac ἐμῆ-ατ
Leo ceterum. which 1 should adopt
did not the contrast with the com-
mon heritage ot'all men as described
in the previous line require cetera.
The neut. plur. was originally
long. Dr Munro suggested cetera
<ea> quae &c-

uti followed by acc., though the
abl. is the more common case in
Plautus. Cf. Epid. 263 utitor con·
silium (note). The abl. in v. 201.

Graeca. mercamur fide, ‘ we
purchase on Greek credit‚’ i.e. sor
cash. ‘ Graeca fides enim nulla
fides est, quoniam Gracciempton‘bus
nihil credunt.' Ussing.

201. discipulina, ‘system,' Mil.
187 earumque artem ct disciplinam
obtineat colere, Cas. 626 quod haud
Atticam condecet disciplinam. Dis-
ciptclina is a parallel form of
diuzPlina. Cf. fizudores, purtgrarc,
extempulo, Introd. p. xxi., and see
Miiller, Hdb. 11.² p. 277·

202. omuatae, ‘our hands have
always eyes, they believe what
they see,’ i.e. we trust no one un-
less we see the price. For the
metaphor cf. Aesch. Cho. 854 οὔτοι

φρέν’ ἂν κλέψειεν ὠμματωμένηντ
Soph. O. C. 74 56' ἂν λε’·γωμεν
πάνθ’ ὁρῶντα λέξομεν, Milton 1’. L.
111. 51—-55‚ Pseud. 30¹ emim die
caeca lzercle oliuom, id nendilo ocu-
lata dic, i.e. buy sor credit and sell
sor cash: and for the word cs.
Truc. 486 pluris cs( oculatus tcstzle
unus, quam auriti decem.

203. uetus est ⁴ 11111 coactiost ’—-
scis cuius. Cleareta says she gives
no credit, and illustrates this by a
proverb part of which she omits.
It is at least probable that the
missing word would metrically fit
into the place os scis cuius which
is unexpectedly substituted sor it.
This word the audience could
supply better than we can. (1) If
we keep nili coactiost (the first two
syllables of coactio scanned as one
by synaeresis) the meaning will
be ‘there's no use calling in—you
know wliat‚' i.e. nothing, or the
money of him who has nothing,
sc. nili or perhaps mendici. And
F. Leo's coemptiost does not much
alter this sense.

(2) But Prof. I'almer makes two
suggestions worth considering (ιι)
nili cautiost scis cuius, sc. mendici
‘a beggar‘s bond is worthless,’
(b) nili coctiosl scis cuius. ‘it's no
use trying to boii you know what,'
a reference to λίθον ἕψειν (Herma-
thena ιν. ¹34 and v. 308). This
