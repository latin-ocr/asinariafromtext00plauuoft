dedo (codd. dedi, corr. Bent-
ley). ‘ I’ve been constantly busy on
’Change looking for someone who
wanted money at interest.' The
real Saurea invested his mistress'
money for her. Faenus, cf. v. 248.

430. enm tn hara, haud aedi·
bns habitat, ‘master is living in
a pig-stye‚ not a house': hara
and co-lzors=something enclosed.
Mart. ιιι. 58 chortis (i.e. cohortis)
:poultry-yard. The line as it
stands is a syllable too long. The
simplest remedy is with Ussing to
read habet for habitat: habet:
habitat is common in Plautus, e.g.
Aul. 5. It is in favour of the
change here that habet in this
sense regularly occurs at the end
of the line. v

431. em ergo hoe tibi (hem
codd.. corr. Brix), ‘there! take
this.' striking him.

432. eho, ecqms aes lam &c.
Aes iam is a conjecture of Schoell’s
to fill up a defective line. Most
editors think ecquis is wrong and
that a proper name is wanted:
Fleckeisen gives (exempli causa)
Coriscus. Leo suggestsHegio ecqui.

In the next line the MSS. give
resoluit.. mavoluit, which cannot
stand; so all editors follow Tume-

430

Li. Hospes, te 6bsecro, defende.

LE. Eho, ecquis <aes iam> pro

LE. Quoi datumst? Li.

LE. Vah, delenire apparas: scio mihi uicarium

bus in reading in the second place
soluit. Ussing and Leo after Bothe
alter the first to rem soluit (see v.
219). With Schoell's supplement
to do this is impossible. Resoluit =
debitum soluit is in itself quite the
right word (see Epid. ¹4²)· But
perhaps we might adopt Goetz's
aes soluit, in which aes would be
repeated from the previous line.
Quoi datumst? makes aes more
probable.

433. soluit, in the absence of a
convenient word for yes! assent is
often expressed in Latin by repeat-
ing the verb of the question, chang-
ing the person is necessary. or by
feci. This practice hasled the scribe,
who found resoluit at the begin-
ning of the line, to repeat it against
the metre in the reply. Libanus
replies to the question by repeat-
ing the verb: ‘has he paid? ‘he
has paid.' He might also have said

ecit.
