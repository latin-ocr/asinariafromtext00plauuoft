inflicted capriciously. but sentence was pronounced and exe-
cuted after a quasi-judicial procedure ε the strictness with which
offences were punished may be inserted from the fact, that one

his master hanged himself on the matter coming to Cato⁷s ears.
For slight offences, such as mistakes committed in waiting at
table, the consular was wont after dinner to administer to the

tresviri and the aediles are grotesquely mixed with agoranomi

a theatre but the pieces were wanting.' Literature carne to
Rome along with the sovereignty of the world.
