and Leonidas fraudulently procure for their young master
Argyrippus.

The plot is of the common type. A young man, Argyrippus,
is in love. The object of his affection, Philaenium, is in danger
of being taken from him by the greed of those who have control
of her, in this case her own mother, Cleareta. But the knavery
of the slaves triumphs over all obstacles, and the money required
to unite the lover with his mistress is procured. Yet there is a
point in which the play presents a contrast to most others of the
same type. The object is not here to cheat a close—fisted father.
The father, Demaenetus, is all too complacent. He shares and
outdoes the vices of his son. The difficulty lies in the fact that
his wife, the lover’s mother, Artemona, has the purse-strings
and holds the reins of authority. Her husband lives in fear
of her, but is only too willing to abet his son and empower his
slaves to circumvent her, if it can be done.

The story is briefly this. Argyrippus, son of Demaenetus
and Artemona, is in love with Philaenium, daughter of the
procuress Cleareta. While his money lasts he has been wel-
comed and made much of, but now that his money is gone
he is forbidden the house, unless he ean forestall his rival,
Diabolus, in paying over 20 minae.

How can this money be obtained? Demaenetus is most
willing to help, hoping that he may have a share in the girl’s
favours if the plot succeeds. Accordingly at the opening of
the play he exhorts the slave Libanus to procure the money
somehow, promising his own connivance (16—126). The next
scenes depict the despair of the lover and the greed of the
procuress in the liveliest colours (127--248). Then Libanus,
who has hit upon no plan, meets Leonidas, who has been more
successful, and they lay their heads together <249—380). Saurea,
the ‘atriensis’ of Artemona, who manages her money for her,
has sold asses to a merchant of Pella for 20 minae. The youth
who has been sent to pay this sum is a stranger and falling
in with Leonidas reveals his errand and his ignorance. Leonidas
declares that he is Saurea and demands the money. But neither
the haughty airs assumed by Leonidas nor all the help given
