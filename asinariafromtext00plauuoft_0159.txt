four dice and four sides of each
were marked. The best throw was
when all four turned up different.
This was iactus Venerius, Mart.
XIV. 14 cum steterit nullus uultu
tibi talus eodem. As the four mark-
ed sides were 1. 3. 4. 6. the sum
of the four numbers in this case
was only 14. It was by obtaining
this throw that the king of the feast
was appointed among the Romans,
and hence it was called basilicus,
Cure. 360. The lowest throw of
all was four aces, Cure. 357 iacit
uolturios quattuor. This is also
known as canis, Prop. v. 8. 45
me quoque per talos Venerem quae-
rente secundos, semper damnosi sub-
siluere canes. Before throwing a
person osten invoked either a god or
his mistress. See vv. 780 and 909.

906. m1 ob iactum mulsum
date. Mulsum = οἰνόμελι uinum
melle conditum.

907. non queo durare, ‘1 can't
stand it‚‘ cf. Amph. 882, Mil. ¹²49·
On this the Parasite makes a joke
of his own, ‘if you've not learnt
the fuller's trade, no wonder‚' the
reference being to the stench en-
dured by those engaged in the
process. Others take durare in a
transitive sensezdurum reddere.
This seems sar-setched, but see

908. Artemona. This is, Ι
believe, the right word to fill up
the gap-v-left in the MSS. here.
The word might be mistaken as
an indication of the speaker and
therefore omitted in the text. And
M. Havet (Revue de l‘liilologie
vl.) takes the same view. But
Prof. Palmer calls nunc cuculo
(Goetz and Loewe) certain. Cu-
culus because the cuckoo lays its
eggs in another bird's nest, see
v'191123o0u1023 inuam optumumst,
sc. Demaeneto the dative being
easily supplied. The Parasite
urges the angry Artemona 'to
rush at his eyes‚' and tear thern
out. Cf. Most. 198, Ter. Eun.648.

909. ego pol uiuam...1nuocast1.
A reference to the wish uttered
by Demaenetus when he throws
the dice (v. 905) sor her death. For
cum tuo magno malo cs. v. 90¹·

910. ecqu1s currit pollinctorem
accersere? Demaenetus collapses
at the sight os his justly angry
wife, and the Parasite asks trium-
phantly ‘is any one going to run
and setch the undertaker?’ On the
use of the infin„ see Roby 1362.

911. mater. salue ..sat saluust..
