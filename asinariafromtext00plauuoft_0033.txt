those of Aristophanes. And they give variety, emphasis and
clearness to the whole play. A change of feeling is accompanied
by a change of metre. Lyrics in Roman Comcdy are ‘the
medium for the exceptional': accelerated rhythm is used for
any scene of emotion or excitement: the ordinary blank verse
(iambi) for quiet scenes where the action is in a state of rest.

The Greek Comedy allowed incidental effects. Such are the
scenes in the Birds and the Clouds, where a number of persons
are brought in for a moment simply for the moment⁷s laugh.
The Frogs may be said to have an under-plot. At first we arc
interested mainly in Xanthias, but when the plot proper begins
we hear no more of him. The Roman authors went further
than this. They worked two plots together. And sometimes
to get two plots they combined two Greek plays (contaminatio).
The favourite characters to create this double interest are the
parasite and the cunning slave. Indeed very few Roman
comedies are content with a single plot. And the interest is
heightened in various wayS, by doubling the characters and
contrasting them, by elevating subordinate into independent
characters, by pourtraying the fortunes of the servants no less
than those of their masters, and so forth. Thus we are coming
to the Shaksperian conception of plot—‘ the weaving of distinct
stories into one common dramatic pattern.' See on this Mi·

(Orantis), Ass—driver‚ Plautus calls it Asinaria (sc. sabula), that

Asinaria is a sem. adj.‚ with sabula understood, such as is
frequently used in the titles of Latin comedies. Similar in-
stances are Aulularia formed from the diminutive of aula,
i.e. olla, ‘a pot,' Cistellaria from cistella the diminutive of
cista, ‘a box‚' and Mostellaria from mostellum the diminutive
of monstrum, ‘a ghost.'

The name is taken from the asses, or rather the money got
by the sale of the asses which the two crafty slaves Libanus
