fortune—a curious contrast to Terence with the favour and
support of the great. Popular as his pieces were in the author's
lifetime he gained his full recognition only after death—-especially
from the death of Terence to nearly the end of the Republic—
and his picces still kept the stage after the establishment of the
Empire.

3. His works. We know little of Plautus’ outex· life, as little
of his inner life, of the training and equipment he had for his
literary work, nothing of his relations to his contemporaries
Naevius and Ennius, and to the art-world of his day. His
attitude to his Greek originals we can determine. The Roman
playwright who adapted for the Roman stage had two courses
open to him. He might model his play to suit Roman life,
altering the scene, the customs, the names, the dress and so
forth, giving a Roman tone and colouring to the whole. Or he
might with the Greek plot keep the Greek customs, places, life
and characters portrayed by the Greek author. If he adopted
the former course the play was known as sabula togata—from
the toga, the Roman national dress, which would in that case
be worn by the actors. If he chose the latter plan, his play was
a sabula palliata, so called from the Greek dress (pallium :=
χλομύς) which his actors wore. Plautus' plays were fabulae
palliatae. (The writers of togatae were later, and generally
represented Italian provincial life. The strict police supervision
and prohibition of politics or personalities madepalliatae easier
to write and exhibit than togatae.) His originals were not' the
plays of the Old Attic Comedy, political and personal, not the
transitional Middle Comedy, but the New Comedy of life and
manners. The Old Comedy was in truth an exceptional Attic
product, which did not last long, and was incapable of re-
production save in a democracy like the Athenian. The New
Comedy from its simplicity, its interest depending on character-
sketching‚ exciting situations and developments, was specially
suitable for transplantation from Athens to Rome. The brilliant
period of the New Comedy at Athens was the half-century that
followed the death of Alexander the Great, its great lights were
Menander, Philemon, Diphilus. As we have seen, Livius
