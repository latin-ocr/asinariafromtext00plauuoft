Qua me', qua uxorem, qua tu seruom Sauream

Potes, circumduce, aufer: promitto tibi
Non obfuturum, si Ι id hodie effeceris.

96. qua... qua... qua potes.
Qua potes, ‘as best you ean,' is
common in Ovid e.g. Trist. 1. 9.
65 qua potes excusa. But qna...
qua are used simply as copula-
tives‚ Mil. 1113 consectare qua
maris qua feminas, ibid. 1392
eum amnes oderunt qua uiri qua
mulieres, Men. 666 qna uirum
qua uxorem di aas perdant. The
use is colloquial until Livy‘s time.
He uses it frequently e.g. lx. 8.
3 reum qua infelicis belli qna igno-
mz'nz'osae pacis. Cicero has it in
Letters only.

97. circumduce, ‘cozen.' Cf.
Pseud. 4 3 1 te uelle amantem mgenlo
circumducere, ibid. 529 aa circum-
ducam lepide lenonem, ibid. 634 δῖε.
Other Plautine synonyms for
cheating are circztmuortere, inter-
nortere, emungere, tangere, tondere.

98. To scan the line as it stands
presupposes hiatus between si id
(a reading taken from Festus p.
198). To avoid this Fleckeisen
inserts me after obfuturum, Gertz
reads si illud leodic, Ussing sz' tu
id hodie.

99—100. iubeas una. opera.
δια, ‘you might as well bid me
take my fishing-net and fish in the
air, my hunting-rod and hunt in
mid sea.’ The MSS. order in v.
100 iS uenarz' aulem rete iaculo in
medio mari. The whole is meant
to express labour lost. ‘To cozen
you‚’ says Libanus, ‘is as vain as
to fish where you ought ‘to fowl,
to fowl where you ought to fish.’
The antithesis is between piscari
in aere and uenam* in medio mari,
and the antithesis is further point-
ed if rete as the appropriate fishing

Iubeas una opera me piscari in aere

instrument be coupled with piscari,
and iaculo as the appropriate
hunting instrument with amari.
But it is urged iaculum (i.e. iacu-
lus, -a, -ιιηι, adj.) is an epithet of
rete, eg. Truc. 35 quasi z'n pisci-
nam rete qui iaculum parat. Hence
Prof. Palmer (Herm. 1v. 245)
proposes piscari in aere Ι rete
iaculo: ucuarz' autem &c., i.e.
gives both words to piscari, while
the MS. order gives both words to
uenat-i. But would iaculo be at-
tached to rete, when there was any
question of fowling? Does not
uenari make iaculo with rete
highly improbable? Believing
that it does, and that the balance
of clauses requires rete to go with
precari, iaculo with uenarz' I fol-

low the transposition suggested by ⁷

Langen Beitr'age p. 81. A num-
ber os other conjectures will be
found in Leo's apparatus criticus.
Mr Spratt points out that in Truc.
35 Plautus is evidently adapting
ἐς βόλον ἕλκει, e.g. Theocr. 1. 40,
and asks whether there is evidence
to shew that rete iaculum is a mere
synonym forfunda. He also sug-
gests that autem may conceal an
aee„ as though piscari is definite
uenam' might call for further speci-
fication.

una opera, ‘you might as well.'
Cf. Most. 2 5 3 una opera ebur atra-
mento candefacere postules, Pseud.
3 ¹9 una opera adligem canem fugi-
tiuum agnz'nzk lactibus, Capt. 563,
Men. 795. Eadem opera as v.
640 is commoner, but means gene-
rally ‘at the same time,’ e.g. Capt.
450, lit. ‘with the same trouble,'
of killing two birds with one stone.
