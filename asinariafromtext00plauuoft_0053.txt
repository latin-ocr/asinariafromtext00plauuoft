DEMAENETVS.

Senex

Sicut tuom uis (micum gnatum tuae

Superesse uitae sospitem et superstitem,
Ita ted obtestor per senectutem tuam
Perque illam quarn tu me‘tuis uxorem tuam:

Ac‘r I, Seme 1 (16—-1 26). The
old father Demaenetus calls Li-
banus aside, tells him that he
knows all about his son Argyrip-
pus», and plots that they may de-
fraud his wife for his son’s benefit.

Metre: Iambici Senarii.

16. gnatum tuae superesse
natae, ‘as you wish your only son
to survive your own lise.’ No
appeal could touch more closely
the Greek or Roman mind. The
parent wished the child to close his
dying eyes. For the child to die
first was a violation of the order os
nature. Hence there was nothing a
father desired more anxiously than
that his children should outlive
him. Cf. Ter. Haut. ¹030 lta mihi
atque huic sis superstes, ut tu ex
me atque hoc natus es. Plin. Epist.
1. 12. 11 among the marks of a
man's happiness it is reckoned
that decessit superstitibus suis. See
also Senec. Cons. ad Marciam 1.

G. A.

2, and Cic. Nat. Deor. 11. 28. 72
where superstitio is derived from
superstes ‘ qui totos dies precabantur
et immolabant, ut sibi sui liberi
superstites essent, superstitiosi sunt
appellati) For further references
consult Prof. Mayor on Juv. x. ²4¹·

18. ted (instead of te to avoid
hiatus before obtestor) Fleckeisen
and later editors. So med v. 20.
Med, ted, sed are probably ablatives
of the personal pronouns that came
to be used as accusative. See 1.
Miiller Handbuch 11.‘-' p. 345.

We expect after obtestor, as
Ussing points out, an object-clause,
e.g. ne quid milzifizlsi dicas. But
with a slight change os structure
Libanus states what he hopes if
Demaenetus deceives him, viz. that
his wife will outlive him, ‘quasi
non ‘ ted obtestor’ sed ⁴ deos precor '
antecesserit. '

ending abuse of wives in Roman
