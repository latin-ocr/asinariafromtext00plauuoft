short Prologus it may be convenient to say something, beyond
what has been said p. xxv, about the Plautine Prologues here.
The Prologue is defined by Aristotle (Poet. ιε) as all that
precedes the first Choral Ode. In the Old Comedy anything
the author wished to say directly to the audience was said not
at the beginning but in the middle of the play by the παράβασις.
In Tragedy, Euripides is the great employer of the Prologue.
His habit is severely criticised by Aristophanes in the Ranae
v. 1200 ff. To Comedy the Prologue was more appropriate, and
was common in the plays of the Middle and New Comedy.
Following the practice of Menander and his contemporaries,
Plautus when he wrote a Prologue usually assigned it to some
one outside the regular dramatis personae. Thus in the
Aulularia the verses are delivered by Lar familiaris, in the
Rudens by Arcturus, in the Trinummus by Luxuria. Terence
used his Prologues for a polemical purpose, to gain the favour

· of the audience and defend himself from the attacks of a rival

poet.

It is assumed that Prologues were at one time prefixed to all
the Plautine plays. The Bacchides, Epidicus, Mostellaria,
Persa, Stichus have none now. The Curculio has none but has
a sort of παράβασις in the Third Act. Only two lines survive of
the Prologue to the Pseudolus. ln the Miles and Cistellaria
the plot is explained in a scene of the First Act. But in the
Amphitruo and Mercator the Prologue is delivered by one
of the persons of the play. Yet the Prologues to the Amphitruo,
Captivi and Poenulus contain references to improvements in the
Theatre-seats &c.—which were not introduced until after the
death of Plautus: that to the Casina declares itself post-Plautine.
The Prologues to seven plays speak not of ‘poeta’ but Plautus
or Maccius, and belong to the revival of Plautine study ‘ in the
first half of the 7th cent. A.U.c.' Setting on one side the
Prologues to the Aulularia, Rudens and Trinummusl we may lay
it down that the extant Prologues are all post—Plautine.

In any case the Prologue is no part of the play proper. It is
