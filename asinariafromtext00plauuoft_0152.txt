ACT V, SCENE 2 (851—end).
To the three persons at table enter
Artemona and the Parasite. They
are unseen by the banqueters until
they shew themselves (v. 909).
Artemona overhears what is pass-
ing, surprises Demaenetus aud
leads him away from the place of
his shame.

The scene is an angry one and
written in septenarian trochaics.

Scenes are often made to begin
like this in the middle of a con-
versation. See Trin. 602, Men.
889, Poen. 959, Ter. Andr. 301,
Eun. 391, Haut. 242 &c.

851. ain tu? ‘do you mean to
say that?’ ain, ain tu, ain uero,
ain tandem always at the begin-
ning of a speech, either interrupt-
ing another speaker, or as au out-
break of surprise and astonishment
at what the other speaker has
said. See Langen, Beitr‘age p. 119.

854. neque diuini neque mi
humani posthac quicquam accre-
duaS‚ ‘never trust me in anything
divine or human‚’ i-e. ‘in anything
at all': for diuina ÷lzumana=

omnia cf. Amph. 258 deduntque
se diuina humanaque omnia and
Liv. 1. 38. 2. For the form ac-
creduo, cf. concreduo, duo, interduo,
Sec. See Brix on Trin. 436.

855. huius rei mendacem. No
other passage is quoted for ther
gen. after mendax. But the geni-
tive is common after adjs. in —ax,
eg. tenax propositi uir, tempus
edax rerum, capacissimus cibi ui-
nique. See Madvig L. G. 289-
290, Roby 1314. The MSS. give
me esse mendacem, the transposition
is Seyffert's. Leo omits esse.

856. scelesta.. ‘unhappy woman
th6at Ι am.' Cf. v. 476 and Amph.
5 2.

praeter alios: μάλιστα. πάντων.

frugi both here and in the
following line cannot be correct,
unless Artemona repeats herself in
the confusion of her amazernent.
Former editors changed frugi in
this line to fui, but rata fui is
incorr-eet. Ussing suggests egre·
gizan, Luchs meum uirum antehac
rata probum. Ribbeck would
keep frugi in this line and substi-
