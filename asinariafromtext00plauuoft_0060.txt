[Ι 1 75-85

Vt<i> sibi amanti facerem argenti copiam: 75
Et id ego percupio obsequi gnato meo.

(Volo amori obsecutum illius, uolo amet me patrem.)
Quamquam illum mater arte contenteque habet,

Patres ut cons<ue>ueruntz ego mitto omnia haec.
Praesertim quom is me dignum quoi concrederet 80
Habuit, me habere honorem eius ingenio decet:

Quom me adiit, ut pude'ntem gnatum aequomst patrem,
Cupio e'sse amicae quod det argentum suae.

L1.

Cupis id quod cupere te nequiquam intellego:

Dotalem seruom Sauream uxor tua domum 85

say this is that &c.’
with Brix's note.

76. id, accusative of limitation‚
‘as to that thing.' So id, quod,
idem frequently in Plautus, cf.
Amph. 909 id lzm reuerti uti me
purgarem tibi, Epid. ¹31 and 192.

77. This line must be obelized.
Obsecutum as a passive is out of
the question. Nonius p. 501
quotes it as amari obsecutam which
does not help. However the
whole verse is so unsatisfactory
and unmetrical that it may be
confidently regarded as one of the
glosses which have found their way
into this scene. Probably the line
is made up of two marginal com-
ments on the preceding verse.

⁷8. contente, συνεσταλμένως
‘parce et continenter, ’ N onius p. 8 3.
Ussing quotes Pacat.Paneg.Theod.
13 parce contenteque uiuentem.

80. quom is me dignum...
habuit. ‘Quom for qnoniam or
quod is used with the indic. in

Cf. Trin. 25

Plautus not only after verbs of
rejoicing (Amph. 636) but also
elsewhere, e.g. Amph. 1150 quom
sum luppiter, Bacch. 531 saluos
quom peregre aduenis, Capt. 4²1
quom optume fecisti, Most. 164

quom lepida tute es &c.‚' Ussing
on Amph. 746. Cf. v. 82 quom me
adiit and v. 1 1 2 quom tu. . animum
ostendisti tuom, and v. 515 quom
illo quem amo prohibeor. Roby
L. G. 1725.

81. habere honorem eius in-
genio, ‘respect his inclinations.'

85. dotalem seruom Sauream

uxor tua domum. The line as ⁷

given in the MSS. is a soot too
short. Dousa proposed Saurecfn
but the form is not Plautine.
Koch would read uoxor (for uxor)
a form found in B Trin. 800 and
Truc. 512 (where it cannot stand).
On this form Ussing well says
‘cauendum‚ ne librariorum errores
pro antiquitatis uestz‘gizs habeamus?
T πα tibi will occur to everyone,
but tibi ends the next line. 1
arrived at domum as the probable
word only to find that Muller had
already suggested it: domum ad-
duxit, ‘brought horne with her
(when she came as a bride)‚' gives
unexceptionable sense.

dotalem seruom, ‘ adowry slave.'
He formed part of the dowry, and
depended solely on the wife: the
husband had no control over him.
Gellius xvxl. 6. 1 quotes Cato to
