PROLOGVS 7

Nunc qu6d me dixi ue'lle uobis dicere

Dicam: huic nomen Graece Onagost fabulae: 10

Asinariam uolt esse, si per uos licet.

Inest lepos ludusque in hac comoedia:

Ridicula res est: date benigne operam mihi.

giving the name and source os
the play. Here the plot is so
short and simple that the name
only need be given.

9. nune ἃς. This line is
bracketed by Ge pert as a mere
repetition of v. . But the Pro-
logues are not free from such
repetitions, and recent editors are
right in leaving the line. It is a
resumption, not a repetition.

10. Onagost, dat. from Ὀναγός,
ass-driver, by the attraction by
which the name is made to agree
with the person in the dat. instead
of being in the nom„ e.g. est mihi
nomen Balbo (not Balbus). Cf.
the passage in the Prologue to the
Trinummus (18—21) with which
this is closely related.

Huic Graece nomen est T hen-

sauro fabulae;

Philemo scripsit,· Plautus uorlit

barbare;

nomen Trinummo fecit,· nunc

uos hoc rogat,

ut liceat possidere lum( nomen

fabulam.

11. On Demophilus and the
name Asinaria see Introduction,
pp. xxxiv. and xxix.

The MSS. give the name as
Maccus, whence old editors think-
ing the poet’s name was M. Accius
Plautuswrote Marcus. But Ritschl
proved from the Ambrosian MS.
that the name is T. Maccius
Plautus (which he elicited from
the end os Cas. Epid. Men. and

Merc. 6). What are we to read
here? It may be supposed that
the name Alaccius was written
Alaccus, or we may write Mtcsus,
or Alaccr's. But this is unsatis-
factory. Buecheler (Rhein. Mus.
41, p. 12) conjectures that the
name „Uaccus (one of the regular
personae Atrllanae, like Bucco,
pappus, Dossennus) meaning ‘ buf-
foon ' is a nickname given to
Plautus as a writer of comedies,
from which on becoming a Roman
citizen he deduced the family name
os Maccius. 'l'his is ingenious and
not improbable.

Of recent editors F. Leo gives
Maccius without further remark
than ‘Maccus codd„ corr. Ritsclze-
lius': Ussing Macizcs; Goetz and
Schoell ( ι 893) Maccus with a reser-
ence to Buecheler’s paper in their
critical preface.

uortit barbare=uortit Latine.
It is a striking proof how essen-
tially Greek in tone these plays
are that whenever it is necessary
to refer to anything Latin in true
Greek sashion it is styled ‘foreign’
(βάρβαρος). Thus Cure. 150 fite
