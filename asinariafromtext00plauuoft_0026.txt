A rarer case is quieto dissyllabic Epid. 338, quiesci, quierint.

The vowels are regularly run together in proin, proinde,
dein, deinde, dehinc, deerrare, dehortor, deosculari, and deesse.

To the same principle we may assign a number of shortened
case—forms, is for iis, isdem for iisdem, and verb-forms exit, redit
(perf.), aibam, aibas, and so on.

6. H latus. The general attitude of Latin to hiatus is given
by Cicero Orat. 150, ‘Quod quidem Latina lingua sic observat,
nemo uttam rusticus sit, qui vocales nolit coniungere? Greek
allowed hiatus, but ‘nobis, ne si cupiamus quidem, distraherel
voces conceditur) Then, after quoting examples of hiatus from
Naevius and Ennius, he concludes ‘hoc idem nostri saepius non
tulissent.’ Quintilian also (ΙΧ. 4. 33) disapproves ‘vocalium con-
cursum, quod cum accidit, hiat et intersistit2 et quasi laborat
oratio!

In Plautus hiatus occurs between two words closely connected
—a preposition and its noun, a pair of nouns, a noun and its
verb, an adjective and its noun, Sec„ de ea, octo hominum,
gratiam habeo, tuam amicam, eri imperia.

But hiatus is practically confined to cases when there is a
pause in metre or in sense which at least tones down the harshness. .
Thus there may be hiatus at the caesura. Most frequently where
hiatus occurs there is a pause in both sense and metre, and,·even
where these double pauses coincide, in an overwhelming number
of cases there is no hiatus, e.g. when one speaker leaves a line
unfinished and another takes it up hiatus is rare.

Hiatus most frequently accompanies breaks in sense when
they are considerable, especially if there is a change of speakers.

q Most frequently hiatus is met with in the case of mono-
syllables with a long vowel (pro, de, Sec.) or a short vowel if the
word ends with m (nam, cum) in cases like quae egO, qui in, nam
ego, ne ego, qui homo, di ament, cum Alcumena, quam ob rem,
qui obviarn.

Cases of hiatus are pretty frequent before homo, in nom.

1 distrahere=to leave an hiatus )( contrahere.
2 intersistit=comes to a standstill.
