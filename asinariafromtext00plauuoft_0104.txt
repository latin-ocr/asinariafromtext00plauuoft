Neque eo e'sse seruom in ae'dibus eri qui sit pluris quam

mes[i]t.

435

Sed uina quae heri uendidi uinario Exaerambo,

Iam pro is satis fecit Sticho?

L1. Fecisse satis opinor:

Nam uidi huc ipsum adducere trapezitam Exaerambum.

LE.

Sic dedero: prius quae credidi, uix anno post exegi.

Nunc sat agit: adducit domum etiam ultro et scribit

nummos.
Dromo mercedem re‘ttulit?
LE. Quid relicuom?
plo redditum esset:

435. eo is really superfluous
with quam illest following, but it is
in the Plautine style. Cf. Mil. 21
periuriorem lzoc...quam z'llz'c est
(where see Brix’s note), Rud. 279
neque lzoc amplius, quam quod
uides, nobis quicquam est.

436. uina quae heri uendidi‚
‘but the wine which I sold yester-
day to Exaerambus the vintner‚
has he satisfied Stichus sor it yet?'
Vina is anticipatory accus., helped
by the relative quae, and resumed
in pro is, i.e. pro iis. Exaerambus
is a name otherwise unknown.
Sarambus or Serambus has been
suggested. But Koenig defends
Exaerambus ‘quasi porlzptomusf

438. trapezitam, ‘for I saw
Exaerambus himself bringing the
banker hither.’ He brought the
banker that he might pay the bill
from the money he had standing
to Exaerambus⁷ credit.

439. sic dedero, ‘that's what
Ι like,’ ‘that's the style for me.’
Cf. Poen. 1²90 sic dedero: aare
militari telegero lenunculum, Ter.
Phorm. 1027 sic dabo. In this
idiom sic datur, ‘that⁷s the way to
do‚’ is common, e.g. Pseud. ¹54 and
Men. 626; cf. Men. 462 obserna
quid dabo, Capt. 492 sic egero,

440
L1. Dimidio minus, opinor.

L1. Aibat reddere, quom exte'm-

Pers. 292 specta quid dedero. Lan-
gen (Beitrage p. 216) discusses the
idiom and shews how it has been
misunderstood by editors here.
440. sat. agit, ‘he feels his
position.’ Sat agere=trepidare,
Bacch. 637 sat agitas tu tuarum
rerum, Merc. 224 in somnis egi
satis et sui homo exercitus, Ter.
Haut. 225, Caes. Bell. Afr. 78.
scribit nummos,
cheque for the money.’
bere is the technical term: ‘to pay
by draft' )( numerare ‘to count
down in cash.⁷ Cf. Ter. Phorm.
92 1 sed transi sodes ad sorum, atque
illud milti argentum rursus iube
rescribi, Phormio, i.e. to be trans-
ferred again by order to my account.
441. Dromo mercedem rettu-
lit? ‘has Dromo brought home his
wages ?' Dromo was a slave hired
out to ply his calling, whose profits
belonged to his owner. Cf. the
hair-dresser (tonstrz'x) Archilis in
the Truculentus. On slaves in
this position, see Marquardt Priv. 1 .
dimidio minus: the abl. may
be of measure or ofeomparison, ‘a
sum less by a half,‘ or ‘less than
a half,’ probably the former.
442. quid relicuom? ‘what
about the balance?'
