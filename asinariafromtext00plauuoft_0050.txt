6 PROLOGVS

[3-8

Gregique huic et dominis atque conductoribus.

Face nunciam tu praeco omnem auritum poplum.
Age minc reside: ca'ue modo ne grati<i>s. 5
Nunc quid processerim huc et quid mihi noluerim

Dicam :

ut sciretis nomen huius fabulae.

Nam quod ad argumentum attinet, sane breuest.

distinction between nunciam and
iam nunc· is that nunciam refers
to the immediate present and future
⁸ in a minute‚’ ⁶ directly,' iam nuncto
the past and present ‘ now already.'

3. gregique huic, ‘this troupe
of actors‚' a sense in which the
word is osten used in the Prologues,
e.g. Cas. 22, Ter. Haut. 45. Cf.
Petronius 80 grex agit in scena
mimum. Caterua has the same

meaning.
dominis. The Mss. agree in
the plur. Fleckeisen and Leo

adopt the correction of Camerarius
domine. But there may very well
have been two or even more per-
sons associated in the management
of a troupe, and Ussing, Goetz
and Schoell are right, Ι think, in
keeping the plural. The manager
of a company (dominus gyegis or
fizctz'onz'S, also (lloraglts), who was
often also the chief actor, was gene-
rally a freedman, and its members
were ordinarily his slaves.

conductoribus, the aediles or
other magistrates who had on this
occasion hired the services of the
company.

4. The herald is asked to secure
the silence and attention of the
people, then to resume his seat.

auritum, ‘i-e. audientem, atten-
tum, cf. Hor. C. Ι. 12. 11 auritas
quercus) Ussing.

5. The herald is made the sub-
ject of a playful hit. He is to have
his ‘pretium pro praeconio.' The
sels-importanee of heralds is fre-

quently ridiculed e.g. by Euripides.
This man, it is hinted, must be
rewarded for his silence as well as
his speech. Cf. Mart. 1x. 68. 11
uis, garrule, quantum accipis ut
clames, accipere ut taceas?

reside. There were at this date
no seats in the theatre. But as
not only the Prologues but Plautus
himself alludes to a sitting audience
(Mil. 82-83, Truc. ad fin.‚ Epid.
ad fin.) most of the spectators
must have brought seats with them
or have seated themselves on the
ground.

With this couplet about the
herald cf. the fuller and clearer
passage, Poen. Prol. 11 ff.

gratiis. See on v. 190.

7. ut sciretis. From the tense
this cannot follow dicam, but pro-
cessi understood from processerim
above. ‘ Now I will tell you why
I came forward (επαρῆλθον)...
(Ι carne forward) that you mIght
know &c.’

8. nam, introductory. This
nam is merely emphatic, cf. enim
and γάρ. The Prologuist gene-
rally explains the plot besides
