For the notes I have consulted Ussing's most useful
edition, Brix's four plays and Langen's Bestriige, with other
books, such as Sonnenschein's Rudens‚ in a less degree.

The references to other plays are usually made to
Brix's text in Trin. Capt. Men. Mil.‚ to Fleckeisen in
Amph. Rud. Bacch. Curc. Stich„ in other plays to Ussing,
except in the Truculentus‚ at which I have worked with
Schoell⁷s text. When the new text by Goetz and Schoell
is complete there will at last be a standard edition for
common reference.

I owe many thanks to my friends Mr R. A. Neil and Mr
A. W. Spratt for their help and to Mr F. G. Plaistowe for
revising the notes in proof. The book Ι know has many
shortcomings, I fear it may have many faults. It airns at
nothing more ambitious than providing a suitable'edition
of an interesting play, not yet edited in English, for the
ordinary classical student, and those who know Plautus
best will probably be my most lenient critics. For any
help to improve the book Ι shall be very grateful.
