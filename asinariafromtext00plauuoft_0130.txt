Agnellum haedillum me tuom dic esse uel uitellum:
Prehende auriculis, compara labe'lla cum labellis.

Philaenium, the second to crumi—
nam. ‘Tell this girl to whom
you're going to give this purse.’

orare mecum, cf. Capt. 337,
Cure. 432, Pers. 320.

663. nam istuc procliuest quo
iubes me plane conlocare, ‘for
that is a slope on which you bid
me set it plainly.' A joke on the
antithesis between procliue and
plane, i.e. locus procliuis and locus
planus. ‘ Ostendit quam parum
lutum sit dare pecuniam A lgryrippc),
nam quae sunt in procliui posita
uicina sunt rm'nae.’ Argyrippus’
neck is a slope: any money placed
there will soon slip off into Philae-
nium's hands. Quo for quod is
a necessary correction: it would
perhaps be a further improvement
to read with Seyffert quo in. For
procliue and plane, cf. Mil. 1018
fecisti moda mi ex proclino planum,
and Rud. 1132.

664. da meus ocenuS, the nom.
is used for the voc.‚ as above v.
655, and used quite indifferently
so that nom. and voc. appear
together. Ofellus, affectionate
diminutive of oculus, ‘apple of my
eye‚' cf. Catull. XXXI. 2 where he
apostrophises Sirmio as ‘ocelle’ of
all islands and half-islands.

rosa, a term naturally applied
only to a maiden fair (Bacch. 83,
Cure. 100, Men. 193), is absurdly
used of the slave.

mi anime, Cure. 98 and 165,
Rud. 1265, infr. 941. Loman
proposes meus animus.

mea. uoluptas, a common ab·
straet for concrete, ‘my darling.’
See on v. 47 3.

665. diiunge, corr. Fleckeisen:
codd. deiunge.

666. Leonidas asks that the
names of all the pet birds and
animals he can think os should be
applied to him. XVhen they are
all brought together in this way
the effect is highly ridiculous.
The diminutives are hypocoristic. ⁷
The sparrow (passer) was a favou-
rite pet with Roman ladies, e.g.
Catull.11.: the quail (coturnix) was
a boy's favourite. See Ar. Av.
707 and the well-known story of
Alcibiades.

667. agnellum haedillum, ui-
teHum diminutives from agnus,
haedus, uitulus. So v. 693 catel-
lus from catulus. Apparently
lzaedz'llus and uitellus occur no-
where else.

668. prehende auriculis, ‘take
hold of me by the ears,’ so as to
draw my face to yours, and then
kiss me. Cf. Poen. 373 sine
prehendam auriculis, sine dem sa-
nium, Tibull. 11. 5. 92 natusque
parenti oscula comprensis auribus
cripiet, Theocr. V. 133·

compara, ‘ join.’ Nonius p. 2 55
comparare est sociare, coniungere.
