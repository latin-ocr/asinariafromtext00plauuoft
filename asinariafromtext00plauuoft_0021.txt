INTRODUCTJOM xvii

is because the n was scarcely sounded, but it may have been
that a syllable was slurred.

Cicero, Orat. 161, discusses the weak sound os final s, and
quotes instances from Lucilius, ἃς, to shew how it was neglected.
Only poetae novi found it a stumbling-block. He himself pro-
nounced maximus maximis in his youth. Thus in Plautus, even
in the 6th foot os the Senarius, which is always a pure iambus,
and at the close of an iambic Tetrameter acatalectic (=not a
syllable short, i.e. with 8 feet), and trochaic Tetranieter catalectic
(=a syllable short, i.e. with γὲ feet), s is not counted. Hence
such terminations as salvos sis, estis nune, occidissss nie, ἃς.

Similarly a mute before a liquid does not assect the length
of the syllable, so that agrOS, libros, duplex, διε. are not spondeos
but iambi.

We may note the following general principles of Plautine
prosody.

A. Shortening of long syllables.

The most noteworthy cases are those in which words which
we should naturally scan as iambi ( v - ) become pyrrhic ( ν ν ).
When the accent or emphasis of pronunciation falls upon the
short first syllable, the second syllable instead of being long is
reckoned as short, probably because in popular pronunciation
the long unemphasised syllable was found heavy and incon-
venient. Thus we get donn, besnis, f6rIs‚—a number os im-
peratives tene, abl, vide, διε. Such words Ennius brought back
to their iambic scansion, and only left the short scansion in such
cases as bene, male ; the variable scansion in such as mihi, tibi,
sibi, ubi, volo, διε.

Instances of this scansion in the Epidicus are Νόνό liberto
v. 727, DedIn tibi v. 703. Other representative cases are novit
pictura (abl.)‚ viros nostros, levi sententia, herl, and potes
adferre, though es not es (znd pers. s. of suni) is the regular
scansion in Comedy.

The regular rule in later Latin is that two consonants—
except a mute before a liquid—render a preceding vowel long
by position. Double letters in Plautus do not lengthen a
vowel—especially 11. Ille, illic frequently have 'the first syllable
