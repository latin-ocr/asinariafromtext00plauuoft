Face id ut paratum iam sit.

the point. See also Senec. Con—
trou. vll. 6 (τι).

86. quoi plue in manu sit, ‘ to
have more power’: Libanus insi-
nuates that Artemona‘s purpose in
bringing Saurea was that he might
have more power than her hus-
band, as if from the outset she
had determined to be independent.
For the phrase cf. Amph. 564
istuc tibist in manu, Rud. 983 in
manu non est mea.

87. dote, the so-called abl. of
price, i.e. instrumenta} abl.

88. quld te uelim, ·‘what I
want with you,’ lit. ‘as to what
thing (see note on v. 76) 1 want
you‚' ef. v. 109 siquid te uolam,
Capt. 618 siquid est quod me uelis,
ibid. 978 siquid me uis impera,
Epid. 512.

89. usust argeum mnne.
Vsus takes the abl. on the analogy
of opus. Perhaps an archaie use
of the verbal noun.

90. id, ‘that sum‚' used as it
osten is in Plautus when an
amount of money has been speci-
fied. Cf. vv. 397—8 where id
refers to the sum implied in ‘asinos
uendidit‚’ Trin. 405 quid factumst
eo? ‘what has become os it?'=
minas qnadraginta (ν. 403), Pseud.
1 150 where hoc refers to the quin-

que minae os the previous line.

91. maxumas nugae agis,
‘you're talking utter nonsense.'
Cf. Men. 54.

92. nudo detrahere uesti-
menta, ‘to strip the clothes offa
nal-:ed man,’ is a proverbial ex-
pression sor attempting the impos-
sible. Cf. κύνα δέρειν δεδαρμένην
(Ar. Lys. 158), which may have
been the original here Ladnised,
and the Scotch expression, “It’s
hard to tak' the breeks offa High-
lander.”

93. defraudem v. 1. defrudcm.
This latter spelling has MS. autho-
rity and is preferred by Ritschl
(Parerg. p. 541). But it seems so
inconsistent to alternate between
the two spellings in the same pas-
sage that, with Leo, the sorni
defraud— is printed in the text
throughout.

sis=si uis, cs. v. 1.

tu sine pennis uola. is another
proverbial expression sor the im-
possible. But it coines inaptly
aster the metaphor os the previous
line and there seems no point in
repeating defraudem &a Hence
editors since Fleckeisen—except
Leo—have bracketed the line.

95. qu1d=aliquid; porro ‘sar-
ther on‚’ ‘in turn.’
